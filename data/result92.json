Let me count the ways.\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\nFor the ends of being and ideal grace.\nI love thee to the level of every day's\nMost quiet need, by sun and candle-light.\nI love thee freely, as men strive for right.\nI love thee purely, as they turn from praise.\nI love thee with the passion put to use\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.\nI love thee with a love I seemed to lose\nWith my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,\nSmiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,\nI shall but love thee better after death.\n",

  "title": "Paul Revere\u2019s Ride",
  "author": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow",
  "text": "Listen, my children, and you shall hear\nOf the midnight ride of Paul Revere,\nOn the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five:\nHardly a man is now alive\nWho remembers that famous day and year.\nHe said to his friend, \u201cIf the British march\nBy land or sea from the town to-night,\nHang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch\nOf the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light,\u2014\nOne if by land, and two if by sea;\nAnd I on the opposite shore will be,\nReady to ride and spread the alarm\nThrough every Middlesex village and farm,\nFor the country-folk to be up and to arm.\u201d\nThen he said \u201cGood night!\u201d and with muffled oar\nSilently rowed to the Charlestown shore,\nJust as the moon rose over the bay,\nWhere swinging wide at her moorings lay\nThe Somerset, British man-of-war:\nA phantom ship, with each mast and spar\nAcross the moon, like a prison-bar,\nAnd a huge black hulk, that was magnified\nBy its own reflection in the tide.\nMeanwhile, his friend, through alley and street\nWanders and watches with eager ears,\nTill in the silence around him he hears\nThe muster of men at the barrack door,\nThe sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,\nAnd the measured tread of the grenadiers\nMarching down to their boats on the shore.\nThen he climbed to the tower of the church,\nUp the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,\nTo the belfry-chamber overhead,\nAnd startled the pigeons from their perch\nOn the sombre rafters, that round him made\nMasses and moving shapes of shade,\u2014\nBy the trembling ladder, steep and tall,\nTo the highest window in the wall,\nWhere he paused to listen and look down\nA moment on the roofs of the town,\nAnd the moonlight flowing over all.\nBeneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,\nIn their night-encampment on the hill,\nWrapped in silence so deep and still\nThat he could hear, like a sentinel\u2019s tread,\nThe watchful night-wind, as it went\nCreeping along from tent to tent,\nAnd seeming to whisper, \u201cAll is well!\u201d\nA moment only he feels the spell\nOf the place and the hour, and the secret dread\nOf the lonely belfry and the dead;\nFor suddenly all his thoughts are bent\nOn a shadowy something far away,\nWhere the river widens to meet the bay,\u2014\nA line of black, that bends and floats\nOn the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.\nMeanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,\nBooted and spurred, with a heavy stride,\nOn the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.\nNow he patted his horse\u2019s side,\nNow gazed on the landscape far and near,\nThen impetuous stamped the earth,\nAnd turned and tightened his saddle-girth;\nBut mostly he watched with eager search\nThe belfry-tower of the old North Church,\nAs it rose above the graves on the hill,\nLonely and spectral and sombre and still.\nAnd lo! as he looks, on the belfry\u2019s height,\nA glimmer, and then a gleam of light!\nHe springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,\nBut lingers and gazes, till full on his sight\nA second lamp in the belfry burns!\nA hurry of hoofs in a village-street,\nA shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,\nAnd beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark\nStruck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet:\nThat was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,\nThe fate of a nation was riding that night;\nAnd the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,\nKindled the land into flame with its heat.\nHe has left the village and mounted the steep,\nAnd beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,\nIs the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;\nAnd under the alders, that skirt its edge,\nNow soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,\nIs heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.\nIt was twelve by the village clock\nWhen he crossed the bridge into Medford town.\nHe heard the crowing of the cock,\nAnd the barking of the farmer\u2019s dog,\nAnd felt the damp of the river-fog,\nThat rises when the sun goes down.\nIt was one by the village clock,\nWhen he galloped into Lexington.\nHe saw the gilded weathercock\nSwim in the moonlight as he passed,\nAnd the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,\nGaze at him with a spectral glare,\nAs if they already stood aghast\nAt the bloody work they would look upon.\nIt was two by the village clock,\nWhen he came to the bridge in Concord town.\nHe heard the bleating of the flock,\nAnd the twitter of birds among the trees,\nAnd felt the breath of the morning breeze\nBlowing over the meadows brown.\nAnd one was safe and asleep in his bed\nWho at the bridge would be first to fall,\nWho that day would be lying dead,\nPierced by a British musket-ball.\nYou know the rest. In the books you have read,\nHow the British Regulars fired and fled,\u2014\nHow the farmers gave them ball for ball,\nFrom behind each fence and farmyard-wall,\nChasing the red-coats down the lane,\nThen crossing the fields to emerge again\nUnder the trees at the turn of the road,\nAnd only pausing to fire and load.\nSo through the night rode Paul Revere;\nAnd so through the night went his cry of alarm\nTo every Middlesex village and farm,\u2014\nA cry of defiance, and not of fear,\nA voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,\nAnd a word that shall echo forevermore!\nFor, borne on the night-wind of the Past,\nThrough all our history, to the last,\nIn the hour of darkness and peril and need,\nThe people will waken and listen to hear\nThe hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,\nAnd the midnight message of Paul Revere.\n",

hesitating then no longer,\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you\"\u2014here I opened wide the door;\u2014\n               Darkness there and nothing more.\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore?\"\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"\u2014\n               Merely this and nothing more.\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore\u2014\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;\u2014\n               'Tis the wind and nothing more!\"\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door\u2014\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door\u2014\n               Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore\u2014\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\n               Quoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning\u2014little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door\u2014\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n               With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing further then he uttered\u2014not a feather then he fluttered\u2014\nTill I scarcely more than muttered \"Other friends have flown before\u2014\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"\n               Then the bird said \"Nevermore.\"\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore\u2014\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\n               Of 'Never\u2014nevermore.'\"\nBut the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore\u2014\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore\n               Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,\nBut whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,\n               She shall press, ah, nevermore!\nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee\u2014by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite\u2014respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!\"\n               Quoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!\u2014prophet still, if bird or devil!\u2014\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted\u2014\nOn this home by Horror haunted\u2014tell me truly, I implore\u2014\nIs there\u2014is there balm in Gilead?\u2014tell me\u2014tell me, I implore!\"\n               Quoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil\u2014prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us\u2014by that God we both adore\u2014\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore\u2014\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\n               Quoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\n\"Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked, upstarting\u2014\n\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!\u2014quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\n               Quoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\n               Shall be lifted\u2014nevermore!\n",

  "text": "The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day:\nThe score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,\nAnd then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,\nA pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game.\nA straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest\nClung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast;\nThey thought, \"If only Casey could but get a whack at that\u2014\nWe'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.\"\nBut Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,\nAnd the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;\nSo upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,\nFor there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.\nBut Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,\nAnd Blake, the much despis\u00e8d, tore the cover off the ball;\nAnd when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,\nThere was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.\nThen from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;\nIt rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;\nIt pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,\nFor Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.\nThere was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;\nThere was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.\nAnd when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,\nNo stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.\nTen thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;\nFive thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;\nThen while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,\nDefiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.\nAnd now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,\nAnd Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.\nClose by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped\u2014\n\"That ain't my style,\" said Casey. \"Strike one!\" the umpire said.\nFrom the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,\nLike the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;\n\"Kill him! Kill the umpire!\" shouted someone on the stand;\nAnd it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.\nWith a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;\nHe stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;\nHe signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;\nBut Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, \"Strike two!\"\n\"Fraud!\" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered \"Fraud!\"\nBut one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.\nThey saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,\nAnd they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.\nThe sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate,\nHe pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;\nAnd now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,\nAnd now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.\nOh, somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright,\nThe band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;\nAnd somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout,\nBut there is no joy in Mudville\u2014mighty Casey has struck out.\n",

Was he happy? The question is absurd:\nHad anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard.\n",

To die: to sleep;\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\nThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks\nThat flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation\nDevoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;\nTo sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\nMust give us pause: there's the respect\nThat makes calamity of so long life;\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\nThe oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\nThe pangs of despised love, the law's delay,\nThe insolence of office and the spurns\nThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\nWith a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\nBut that the dread of something after death,\nThe undiscover'd country from whose bourn\nNo traveller returns, puzzles the will\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all;\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\nIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment\nWith this regard their currents turn awry,\nAnd lose the name of action.\u2014Soft you now!\nThe fair Ophelia!

There was   \n               that interval of moonless calm filled only   \n               with the water\u2019s and the rigging\u2019s usual sounds,   \n               then sudden movement, blows and snarling cries   \n               and they had fallen on us with machete   \n               and marlinspike. It was as though the very   \n               air, the night itself were striking us.   \n               Exhausted by the rigors of the storm, \n               we were no match for them. Our men went down   \n               before the murderous Africans. Our loyal   \n               Celestino ran from below with gun   \n               and lantern and I saw, before the cane- \n               knife\u2019s wounding flash, Cinquez, \n               that surly brute who calls himself a prince,   \n               directing, urging on the ghastly work. \n               He hacked the poor mulatto down, and then   \n               he turned on me. The decks were slippery \n               when daylight finally came. It sickens me   \n               to think of what I saw, of how these apes   \n               threw overboard the butchered bodies of \n               our men, true Christians all, like so much jetsam.   \n               Enough, enough. The rest is quickly told:   \n               Cinquez was forced to spare the two of us   \n               you see to steer the ship to Africa,   \n               and we like phantoms doomed to rove the sea   \n               voyaged east by day and west by night,   \n               deceiving them, hoping for rescue,   \n               prisoners on our own vessel, till   \n               at length we drifted to the shores of this   \n               your land, America, where we were freed   \n               from our unspeakable misery. Now we   \n               demand, good sirs, the extradition of   \n               Cinquez and his accomplices to La   \n               Havana. And it distresses us to know   \n               there are so many here who seem inclined   \n               to justify the mutiny of these blacks.   \n               We find it paradoxical indeed \n               that you whose wealth, whose tree of liberty   \n               are rooted in the labor of your slaves \n               should suffer the august John Quincy Adams   \n               to speak with so much passion of the right   \n               of chattel slaves to kill their lawful masters   \n               and with his Roman rhetoric weave a hero\u2019s   \n               garland for Cinquez. I tell you that   \n               we are determined to return to Cuba \n               with our slaves and there see justice done. Cinquez\u2014 \n               or let us say \u2018the Prince\u2019\u2014Cinquez shall die.\u201d \n       The deep immortal human wish,   \n       the timeless will: \n               Cinquez its deathless primaveral image,   \n               life that transfigures many lives. \n       Voyage through death \n                                     to life upon these shores.\n",

  "text": "I wandered lonely as a Cloud\n   That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills,\nWhen all at once I saw a crowd,\n   A host of golden Daffodils;\nBeside the Lake, beneath the trees,\nFluttering and dancing in the breeze.\nContinuous as the stars that shine\n   And twinkle on the Milky Way,\nThey stretched in never-ending line\n   Along the margin of a bay:\nTen thousand saw I at a glance,\nTossing their heads in sprightly dance.\nThe waves beside them danced, but they\n   Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:\u2014\nA Poet could not but be gay\n   In such a jocund company:\nI gazed\u2014and gazed\u2014but little thought\nWhat wealth the shew to me had brought:\nFor oft when on my couch I lie\n   In vacant or in pensive mood,\nThey flash upon that inward eye\n   Which is the bliss of solitude,\nAnd then my heart with pleasure fills,\nAnd dances with the Daffodils.\n",

  "text": "I\nHe did not wear his scarlet coat,\n  For blood and wine are red,\nAnd blood and wine were on his hands\n  When they found him with the dead,\nThe poor dead woman whom he loved,\n  And murdered in her bed.\nHe walked amongst the Trial Men\n  In a suit of shabby grey;\nA cricket cap was on his head,\n  And his step seemed light and gay;\nBut I never saw a man who looked\n  So wistfully at the day.\nI never saw a man who looked\n  With such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\n  Which prisoners call the sky,\nAnd at every drifting cloud that went\n  With sails of silver by.\nI walked, with other souls in pain,\n  Within another ring,\nAnd was wondering if the man had done\n  A great or little thing,\nWhen a voice behind me whispered low,\n  \"That fellow's got to swing.\"\nDear Christ! the very prison walls\n  Suddenly seemed to reel,\nAnd the sky above my head became\n  Like a casque of scorching steel;\nAnd, though I was a soul in pain,\n  My pain I could not feel.\nI only knew what hunted thought\n  Quickened his step, and why\nHe looked upon the garish day\n  With such a wistful eye;\nThe man had killed the thing he loved\n  And so he had to die.\nYet each man kills the thing he loves\n  By each let this be heard,\nSome do it with a bitter look,\n  Some with a flattering word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\n  The brave man with a sword!\nSome kill their love when they are young,\n  And some when they are old;\nSome strangle with the hands of Lust,\n  Some with the hands of Gold:\nThe kindest use a knife, because\n  The dead so soon grow cold.\nSome love too little, some too long,\n  Some sell, and others buy;\nSome do the deed with many tears,\n  And some without a sigh:\nFor each man kills the thing he loves,\nnbsp; Yet each man does not die.\nHe does not die a death of shame\n  On a day of dark disgrace,\nNor have a noose about his neck,\n  Nor a cloth upon his face,\nNor drop feet foremost through the floor\n  Into an empty place\nHe does not sit with silent men\n  Who watch him night and day;\nWho watch him when he tries to weep,\n  And when he tries to pray;\nWho watch him lest himself should rob\n  The prison of its prey.\nHe does not wake at dawn to see\n  Dread figures throng his room,\nThe shivering Chaplain robed in white,\n  The Sheriff stern with gloom,\nAnd the Governor all in shiny black,\n  With the yellow face of Doom.\nHe does not rise in piteous haste\n  To put on convict-clothes,\nWhile some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes\n  Each new and nerve-twitched pose,\nFingering a watch whose little ticks\n  Are like horrible hammer-blows.\nHe does not know that sickening thirst\n  That sands one's throat, before\nThe hangman with his gardener's gloves\n  Slips through the padded door,\nAnd binds one with three leathern thongs,\n  That the throat may thirst no more.\nHe does not bend his head to hear\n  The Burial Office read,\nNor, while the terror of his soul\n  Tells him he is not dead,\nCross his own coffin, as he moves\n  Into the hideous shed.\nHe does not stare upon the air\n  Through a little roof of glass;\nHe does not pray with lips of clay\n  For his agony to pass;\nNor feel upon his shuddering cheek\n  The kiss of Caiaphas.\nII\nSix weeks our guardsman walked the yard,\n  In a suit of shabby grey:\nHis cricket cap was on his head,\n  And his step seemed light and gay,\nBut I never saw a man who looked\n  So wistfully at the day.\nI never saw a man who looked\n  With such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\n  Which prisoners call the sky,\nAnd at every wandering cloud that trailed\n  Its raveled fleeces by.\nHe did not wring his hands, as do\n  Those witless men who dare\nTo try to rear the changeling Hope\n  In the cave of black Despair:\nHe only looked upon the sun,\n  And drank the morning air.\nHe did not wring his hands nor weep,\n  Nor did he peek or pine,\nBut he drank the air as though it held\n  Some healthful anodyne;\nWith open mouth he drank the sun\n  As though it had been wine!\nAnd I and all the souls in pain,\n  Who tramped the other ring,\nForgot if we ourselves had done\n  A great or little thing,\nAnd watched with gaze of dull amaze\n  The man who had to swing.\nAnd strange it was to see him pass\n  With a step so light and gay,\nAnd strange it was to see him look\n  So wistfully at the day,\nAnd strange it was to think that he\n  Had such a debt to pay.\nFor oak and elm have pleasant leaves\n  That in the spring-time shoot:\nBut grim to see is the gallows-tree,\n  With its adder-bitten root,\nAnd, green or dry, a man must die\n  Before it bears its fruit!\nThe loftiest place is that seat of grace\n  For which all worldlings try:\nBut who would stand in hempen band\n  Upon a scaffold high,\nAnd through a murderer's collar take\n  His last look at the sky?\nIt is sweet to dance to violins\n  When Love and Life are fair:\nTo dance to flutes, to dance to lutes\n  Is delicate and rare:\nBut it is not sweet with nimble feet\n  To dance upon the air!\nSo with curious eyes and sick surmise\n  We watched him day by day,\nAnd wondered if each one of us\n  Would end the self-same way,\nFor none can tell to what red Hell\n  His sightless soul may stray.\nAt last the dead man walked no more\n  Amongst the Trial Men,\nAnd I knew that he was standing up\n  In the black dock's dreadful pen,\nAnd that never would I see his face\n  In God's sweet world again.\nLike two doomed ships that pass in storm\n  We had crossed each other's way:\nBut we made no sign, we said no word,\n  We had no word to say;\nFor we did not meet in the holy night,\n  But in the shameful day.\nA prison wall was round us both,\n  Two outcast men were we:\nThe world had thrust us from its heart,\n  And God from out His care:\nAnd the iron gin that waits for Sin\n  Had caught us in its snare.\nIII\nIn Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,\n  And the dripping wall is high,\nSo it was there he took the air\n  Beneath the leaden sky,\nAnd by each side a Warder walked,\n  For fear the man might die.\nOr else he sat with those who watched\n  His anguish night and day;\nWho watched him when he rose to weep,\n  And when he crouched to pray;\nWho watched him lest himself should rob\n  Their scaffold of its prey.\nThe Governor was strong upon\n  The Regulations Act:\nThe Doctor said that Death was but\n  A scientific fact:\nAnd twice a day the Chaplain called\n  And left a little tract.\nAnd twice a day he smoked his pipe,\n  And drank his quart of beer:\nHis soul was resolute, and held\n  No hiding-place for fear;\nHe often said that he was glad\n  The hangman's hands were near.\nBut why he said so strange a thing\n  No Warder dared to ask:\nFor he to whom a watcher's doom\n  Is given as his task,\nMust set a lock upon his lips,\n  And make his face a mask.\nOr else he might be moved, and try\n  To comfort or console:\nAnd what should Human Pity do\n  Pent up in Murderers' Hole?\nWhat word of grace in such a place\n  Could help a brother's soul?\nWith slouch and swing around the ring\n  We trod the Fool's Parade!\nWe did not care: we knew we were\n  The Devil's Own Brigade:\nAnd shaven head and feet of lead\n  Make a merry masquerade.\nWe tore the tarry rope to shreds\n  With blunt and bleeding nails;\nWe rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,\n  And cleaned the shining rails:\nAnd, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,\n  And clattered with the pails.\nWe sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,\n  We turned the dusty drill:\nWe banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,\n  And sweated on the mill:\nBut in the heart of every man\n  Terror was lying still.\nSo still it lay that every day\n  Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:\nAnd we forgot the bitter lot\n  That waits for fool and knave\nTill once, as we tramped in from work,\n  We passed an open grave.\nWith yawning mouth the yellow hole\n  Gaped for a living thing;\nThe very mud cried out for blood\n  To the thirsty asphalte ring:\nAnd we knew that ere one dawn grew fair\n  Some prisoner had to swing.\nRight in we went, with soul intent\n  On Death and Dread and Doom:\nThe hangman, with his little bag,\n  Went shuffling through the gloom\nAnd each man trembled as he crept\n  Into his numbered tomb.\nThat night the empty corridors\n  Were full of forms of Fear,\nAnd up and down the iron town\n  Stole feet we could not hear,\nAnd through the bars that hide the stars\n  White faces seemed to peer.\nHe lay as one who lies and dreams\n  In a pleasant meadow-land,\nThe watcher watched him as he slept,\n  And could not understand\nHow one could sleep so sweet a sleep\n  With a hangman close at hand?\nBut there is no sleep when men must weep\n  Who never yet have wept:\nSo we\u2014the fool, the fraud, the knave\u2014\n  That endless vigil kept,\nAnd through each brain on hands of pain\n  Another's terror crept.\nAlas! it is a fearful thing\n  To feel another's guilt!\nFor, right within, the sword of Sin\n  Pierced to its poisoned hilt,\nAnd as molten lead were the tears we shed\n  For the blood we had not spilt.\nThe Warders with their shoes of felt\n  Crept by each padlocked door,\nAnd peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,\n  Grey figures on the floor,\nAnd wondered why men knelt to pray\n  Who never prayed before.\nAll through the night we knelt and prayed,\n  Mad mourners of a corpse!\nThe troubled plumes of midnight were\n  The plumes upon a hearse:\nAnd bitter wine upon a sponge\n  Was the savior of Remorse.\nThe cock crew, the red cock crew,\n  But never came the day:\nAnd crooked shape of Terror crouched,\n  In the corners where we lay:\nAnd each evil sprite that walks by night\n  Before us seemed to play.\nThey glided past, they glided fast,\n  Like travelers through a mist:\nThey mocked the moon in a rigadoon\n  Of delicate turn and twist,\nAnd with formal pace and loathsome grace\n  The phantoms kept their tryst.\nWith mop and mow, we saw them go,\n  Slim shadows hand in hand:\nAbout, about, in ghostly rout\n  They trod a saraband:\nAnd the damned grotesques made arabesques,\n  Like the wind upon the sand!\nWith the pirouettes of marionettes,\n  They tripped on pointed tread:\nBut with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,\n  As their grisly masque they led,\nAnd loud they sang, and loud they sang,\n  For they sang to wake the dead.\n\"Oho!\" they cried, \"The world is wide,\n  But fettered limbs go lame!\nAnd once, or twice, to throw the dice\n  Is a gentlemanly game,\nBut he does not win who plays with Sin\n  In the secret House of Shame.\"\nNo things of air these antics were\n  That frolicked with such glee:\nTo men whose lives were held in gyves,\n  And whose feet might not go free,\nAh! wounds of Christ! they were living things,\n  Most terrible to see.\nAround, around, they waltzed and wound;\n  Some wheeled in smirking pairs:\nWith the mincing step of demirep\n  Some sidled up the stairs:\nAnd with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,\n  Each helped us at our prayers.\nThe morning wind began to moan,\n  But still the night went on:\nThrough its giant loom the web of gloom\n  Crept till each thread was spun:\nAnd, as we prayed, we grew afraid\n  Of the Justice of the Sun.\nThe moaning wind went wandering round\n  The weeping prison-wall:\nTill like a wheel of turning-steel\n  We felt the minutes crawl:\nO moaning wind! what had we done\n  To have such a seneschal?\nAt last I saw the shadowed bars\n  Like a lattice wrought in lead,\nMove right across the whitewashed wall\n  That faced my three-plank bed,\nAnd I knew that somewhere in the world\n  God's dreadful dawn was red.\nAt six o'clock we cleaned our cells,\n  At seven all was still,\nBut the sough and swing of a mighty wing\n  The prison seemed to fill,\nFor the Lord of Death with icy breath\n  Had entered in to kill.\nHe did not pass in purple pomp,\n  Nor ride a moon-white steed.\nThree yards of cord and a sliding board\n  Are all the gallows' need:\nSo with rope of shame the Herald came\n  To do the secret deed.\nWe were as men who through a fen\n  Of filthy darkness grope:\nWe did not dare to breathe a prayer,\n  Or give our anguish scope:\nSomething was dead in each of us,\n  And what was dead was Hope.\nFor Man's grim Justice goes its way,\n  And will not swerve aside:\nIt slays the weak, it slays the strong,\n  It has a deadly stride:\nWith iron heel it slays the strong,\n  The monstrous parricide!\nWe waited for the stroke of eight:\n  Each tongue was thick with thirst:\nFor the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate\n  That makes a man accursed,\nAnd Fate will use a running noose\n  For the best man and the worst.\nWe had no other thing to do,\n  Save to wait for the sign to com\nSo, like things of stone in a valley lone,\n  Quiet we sat and dumb:\nBut each man's heart beat thick and quick\n  Like a madman on a drum!\nWith sudden shock the prison-clock\n  Smote on the shivering air,\nAnd from all the gaol rose up a wail\n  Of impotent despair,\nLike the sound that frightened marshes hear\n  From a leper in his lair.\nAnd as one sees most fearful things\n  In the crystal of a dream,\nWe saw the greasy hempen rope\n  Hooked to the blackened beam,\nAnd heard the prayer the hangman's snare\n  Strangled into a scream.\nAnd all the woe that moved him so\n  That he gave that bitter cry,\nAnd the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,\n  None knew so well as I:\nFor he who lives more lives than one\n  More deaths than one must die.\nIV\nThere is no chapel on the day\n  On which they hang a man:\nThe Chaplain's heart is far too sick,\n  Or his face is far too wan,\nOr there is that written in his eyes\n  Which none should look upon.\nSo they kept us close till nigh on noon,\n  And then they rang the bell,\nAnd the Warders with their jingling keys\n  Opened each listening cell,\nAnd down the iron stair we tramped,\n  Each from his separate Hell.\nOut into God's sweet air we went,\n  But not in wonted way,\nFor this man's face was white with fear,\n  And that man's face was grey,\nAnd I never saw sad men who looked\n  So wistfully at the day.\nI never saw sad men who looked\n  With such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\n  We prisoners called the sky,\nAnd at every careless cloud that passed\n  In happy freedom by.\nBut there were those amongst us all\n  Who walked with downcast head,\nAnd knew that, had each got his due,\n  They should have died instead:\nHe had but killed a thing that lived\n  Whilst they had killed the dead.\nFor he who sins a second time\n  Wakes a dead soul to pain,\nAnd draws it from its spotted shroud,\n  And makes it bleed again,\nAnd makes it bleed great gouts of blood\n  And makes it bleed in vain!\nLike ape or clown, in monstrous garb\n  With crooked arrows starred,\nSilently we went round and round\n  The slippery asphalte yard;\nSilently we went round and round,\n  And no man spoke a word.\nSilently we went round and round,\n  And through each hollow mind\nThe memory of dreadful things\n  Rushed like a dreadful wind,\nAnd Horror stalked before each man,\n  And terror crept behind.\nThe Warders strutted up and down,\n  And kept their herd of brutes,\nTheir uniforms were spick and span,\n  And they wore their Sunday suits,\nBut we knew the work they had been at\n  By the quicklime on their boots.\nFor where a grave had opened wide,\n  There was no grave at all:\nOnly a stretch of mud and sand\n  By the hideous prison-wall,\nAnd a little heap of burning lime,\n  That the man should have his pall.\nFor he has a pall, this wretched man,\n  Such as few men can claim:\nDeep down below a prison-yard,\n  Naked for greater shame,\nHe lies, with fetters on each foot,\n  Wrapt in a sheet of flame!\nAnd all the while the burning lime\n  Eats flesh and bone away,\nIt eats the brittle bone by night,\n  And the soft flesh by the day,\nIt eats the flesh and bones by turns,\n  But it eats the heart alway.\nFor three long years they will not sow\n  Or root or seedling there:\nFor three long years the unblessed spot\n  Will sterile be and bare,\nAnd look upon the wondering sky\n  With unreproachful stare.\nThey think a murderer's heart would taint\n  Each simple seed they sow.\nIt is not true! God's kindly earth\n  Is kindlier than men know,\nAnd the red rose would but blow more red,\n  The white rose whiter blow.\nOut of his mouth a red, red rose!\n  Out of his heart a white!\nFor who can say by what strange way,\n  Christ brings his will to light,\nSince the barren staff the pilgrim bore\n  Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?\nBut neither milk-white rose nor red\n  May bloom in prison air;\nThe shard, the pebble, and the flint,\n  Are what they give us there:\nFor flowers have been known to heal\n  A common man's despair.\nSo never will wine-red rose or white,\n  Petal by petal, fall\nOn that stretch of mud and sand that lies\n  By the hideous prison-wall,\nTo tell the men who tramp the yard\n<7nbsp; That God's Son died for all.\nYet though the hideous prison-wall\n  Still hems him round and round,\nAnd a spirit man not walk by night\n  That is with fetters bound,\nAnd a spirit may not weep that lies\n  In such unholy ground,\nHe is at peace\u2014this wretched man\u2014\n  At peace, or will be soon:\nThere is no thing to make him mad,\n  Nor does Terror walk at noon,\nFor the lampless Earth in which he lies\n  Has neither Sun nor Moon.\nThey hanged him as a beast is hanged:\n  They did not even toll\nA reguiem that might have brought\n  Rest to his startled soul,\nBut hurriedly they took him out,\n  And hid him in a hole.\nThey stripped him of his canvas clothes,\n  And gave him to the flies;\nThey mocked the swollen purple throat\n  And the stark and staring eyes:\nAnd with laughter loud they heaped the shroud\n  In which their convict lies.\nThe Chaplain would not kneel to pray\n  By his dishonored grave:\nNor mark it with that blessed Cross\n  That Christ for sinners gave,\nBecause the man was one of those\n  Whom Christ came down to save.\nYet all is well; he has but passed\n  To Life's appointed bourne:\nAnd alien tears will fill for him\n  Pity's long-broken urn,\nFor his mourner will be outcast men,\n  And outcasts always mourn.\nV\nI know not whether Laws be right,\n  Or whether Laws be wrong;\nAll that we know who lie in gaol\n  Is that the wall is strong;\nAnd that each day is like a year,\n  A year whose days are long.\nBut this I know, that every Law\n  That men have made for Man,\nSince first Man took his brother's life,\n  And the sad world began,\nBut straws the wheat and saves the chaff\n  With a most evil fan.\nThis too I know\u2014and wise it were\n  If each could know the same\u2014\nThat every prison that men build\n  Is built with bricks of shame,\nAnd bound with bars lest Christ should see\n  How men their brothers maim.\nWith bars they blur the gracious moon,\n  And blind the goodly sun:\nAnd they do well to hide their Hell,\n  For in it things are done\nThat Son of God nor son of Man\n  Ever should look upon!\nThe vilest deeds like poison weeds\n  Bloom well in prison-air:\nIt is only what is good in Man\n  That wastes and withers there:\nPale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,\n  And the Warder is Despair\nFor they starve the little frightened child\n  Till it weeps both night and day:\nAnd they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,\n  And gibe the old and grey,\nAnd some grow mad, and all grow bad,\n  And none a word may say.\nEach narrow cell in which we dwell\n  Is foul and dark latrine,\nAnd the fetid breath of living Death\n  Chokes up each grated screen,\nAnd all, but Lust, is turned to dust\n  In Humanity's machine.\nThe brackish water that we drink\n  Creeps with a loathsome slime,\nAnd the bitter bread they weigh in scales\n  Is full of chalk and lime,\nAnd Sleep will not lie down, but walks\n  Wild-eyed and cries to Time.\nBut though lean Hunger and green Thirst\n  Like asp with adder fight,\nWe have little care of prison fare,\n  For what chills and kills outright\nIs that every stone one lifts by day\n  Becomes one's heart by night.\nWith midnight always in one's heart,\n  And twilight in one's cell,\nWe turn the crank, or tear the rope,\n  Each in his separate Hell,\nAnd the silence is more awful far\n  Than the sound of a brazen bell.\nAnd never a human voice comes near\n  To speak a gentle word:\nAnd the eye that watches through the door\n  Is pitiless and hard:\nAnd by all forgot, we rot and rot,\n  With soul and body marred.\nAnd thus we rust Life's iron chain\n  Degraded and alone:\nAnd some men curse, and some men weep,\n  And some men make no moan:\nBut God's eternal Laws are kind\n  And break the heart of stone.\nAnd every human heart that breaks,\n  In prison-cell or yard,\nIs as that broken box that gave\n  Its treasure to the Lord,\nAnd filled the unclean leper's house\n  With the scent of costliest nard.\nAh! happy day they whose hearts can break\n  And peace of pardon win!\nHow else may man make straight his plan\n  And cleanse his soul from Sin?\nHow else but through a broken heart\n  May Lord Christ enter in?\nAnd he of the swollen purple throat.\n  And the stark and staring eyes,\nWaits for the holy hands that took\n  The Thief to Paradise;\nAnd a broken and a contrite heart\n  The Lord will not despise.\nThe man in red who reads the Law\n  Gave him three weeks of life,\nThree little weeks in which to heal\n  His soul of his soul's strife,\nAnd cleanse from every blot of blood\n  The hand that held the knife.\nAnd with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,\n  The hand that held the steel:\nFor only blood can wipe out blood,\n  And only tears can heal:\nAnd the crimson stain that was of Cain\n  Became Christ's snow-white seal.\nVI\nIn Reading gaol by Reading town\n  There is a pit of shame,\nAnd in it lies a wretched man\n  Eaten by teeth of flame,\nIn burning winding-sheet he lies,\n  And his grave has got no name.\nAnd there, till Christ call forth the dead,\n  In silence let him lie:\nNo need to waste the foolish tear,\n  Or heave the windy sigh:\nThe man had killed the thing he loved,\n  And so he had to die.\nAnd all men kill the thing they love,\n  By all let this be heard,\nSome do it with a bitter look,\n  Some with a flattering word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\n  The brave man with a sword!\n",

It says,\nCome, rest here by my side.\nEach of you, a bordered country,\nDelicate and strangely made proud,\nYet thrusting perpetually under siege.\nYour armed struggles for profit\nHave left collars of waste upon\nMy shore, currents of debris upon my breast.\nYet today I call you to my riverside,\nIf you will study war no more. Come,\nClad in peace, and I will sing the songs\nThe Creator gave to me when I and the\nTree and the rock were one.\nBefore cynicism was a bloody sear across your\nBrow and when you yet knew you still\nKnew nothing.\nThe River sang and sings on.\nThere is a true yearning to respond to\nThe singing River and the wise Rock.\nSo say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew\nThe African, the Native American, the Sioux,\nThe Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek\nThe Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheik,\nThe Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,\nThe privileged, the homeless, the Teacher.\nThey hear. They all hear\nThe speaking of the Tree.\nThey hear the first and last of every Tree\nSpeak to humankind today. Come to me, here beside the River.\nPlant yourself beside the River.\nEach of you, descendant of some passed\nOn traveller, has been paid for.\nYou, who gave me my first name, you,\nPawnee, Apache, Seneca, you\nCherokee Nation, who rested with me, then\nForced on bloody feet,\nLeft me to the employment of\nOther seekers\u2014desperate for gain,\nStarving for gold.\nYou, the Turk, the Arab, the Swede, the German, the Eskimo, the Scot,\nYou the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought,\nSold, stolen, arriving on the nightmare\nPraying for a dream.\nHere, root yourselves beside me.\nI am that Tree planted by the River,\nWhich will not be moved.\nI, the Rock, I the River, I the Tree\nI am yours\u2014your passages have been paid.\nLift up your faces, you have a piercing need\nFor this bright morning dawning for you.\nHistory, despite its wrenching pain\nCannot be unlived, but if faced\nWith courage, need not be lived again.\nLift up your eyes upon\nThis day breaking for you.\nGive birth again\nTo the dream.\nWomen, children, men,\nTake it into the palms of your hands,\nMold it into the shape of your most\nPrivate need. Sculpt it into\nThe image of your most public self.\nLift up your hearts\nEach new hour holds new chances\nFor a new beginning.\nDo not be wedded forever\nTo fear, yoked eternally\nTo brutishness.\nThe horizon leans forward,\nOffering you space to place new steps of change.\nHere, on the pulse of this fine day\nYou may have the courage\nTo look up and out and upon me, the\nRock, the River, the Tree, your country.\nNo less to Midas than the mendicant.\nNo less to you now than the mastodon then.\nHere, on the pulse of this new day\nYou may have the grace to look up and out\nAnd into your sister\u2019s eyes, and into\nYour brother\u2019s face, your country\nAnd say simply\nVery simply\nWith hope\u2014\nGood morning.\n",

Lucky to be out.\nLucky to be out in the cold world with my mother.\nI\u2019m innocent, I wanted to say. \nA little white girl, trying out her innocence.\nA white lamb, born into a cold field.\nFrozen almost solid. Brought into the house. \nWarmed all night with hair dryers.\nDeath? I said. Smiling. Lucky.\nWe\u2019re barely to the parking lot.\nBarely to the car ride home.\nBut the classroom already feels like the distant past.\nLong ago, my classmates pitying me.\nArriving at this car full of uncles.\nWere they wearing suits? Death such a formal occasion.\nMy sister, angry-crying next to me.\nMe, encountering a fragment of evil in myself.\nEvilly wanting my mother to say it.\nWhat? I asked, smiling. My lamb on full display at the fair.\nHe\u2019s dead! my sister said. Hit me in the gut with her flute.\nHer flute case. Her rental flute. He\u2019s dead!\nOur father.\nOur father, who we were not supposed to know had been dying.\nHe\u2019s dead! The flute gleaming in its red case.\nHere, my mother said at home.\nShe\u2019d poured us each a small glass of Pepsi\nWe normally couldn\u2019t afford Pepsi.\nLucky, I acted.\nHe\u2019s no longer suffering, my mother said.\nHere, she said. Drink this.\nThe little bubbles flew. They bit my tongue.\nMy evil persisted. What is death? I asked.\nAnd now, dream, once more you bring me my answer.\nDig, my mother says. Pry, she says.\nI don\u2019t want to see, dream.\nThe lid so damp it crumbles under my hands.\nThe casket just a drawerful of bones.\nA drawerful. Just bones and teeth.\nThat one tooth he had. Crooked like mine.\n",

Nobody sees her without the hoops firing in her\nEars because nobody sees. Tattooed across her chest she claims\nIs \nWhere I am her son, pent in blackness and turning the night's calm\nLoose and letting the same blood fire through me. In her bomb hair:\nShells full of thunder; in her mouth: the fingers of some calamity,\nSomebody foolish enough to love her foolishly. Those who could hear\nNo music weren't listening\u2014and when I say it, it's like claiming\nShe's an elegy. It rhymes, because of her, with effigy. Because of her,\nIf there is no smoke, there is no party. I think of you, Miss Calamity,\nEvery Sunday. I think of you on Monday. I think of you hurling hurt\nWhere the moon should be and stomping into our darkness calmly.\n",

Not like I\u2019m dying\nfor a letter from the class stoner\nten years on but\u2026\nDo you remember the way the girls\nwould call out \u201clove you!\u201d\nconveniently leaving out the \u201cI\u201d\nas if they didn\u2019t want to commit\nto their own declaration.\nI agree that the \u201cI\u201d is a pretty heavy concept\nand hope you won\u2019t get uncomfortable\nif I should go into some deeper stuff here.\nThere are things I\u2019ve given up on\nlike recording funny answering-machine messages.\nIt\u2019s part of growing older\nand the human race as a group\nhas matured along the same lines.\nIt seems our comedy dates the quickest.\nIf you laugh out loud at Shakespeare\u2019s jokes\nI hope you won\u2019t be insulted\nif I say you\u2019re trying too hard.\nEven sketches from the original Saturday Night Live\nseem slow-witted and obvious now.\nIt\u2019s just that our advances are irrepressible.\nNowadays little kids can\u2019t even set up lemonade stands.\nIt makes people too self-conscious about the past,\nthough try explaining that to a kid.\nI\u2019m not saying it should be this way.\nAll this new technology\nwill eventually give us new feelings\nthat will never completely displace the old ones,\nleaving everyone feeling quite nervous\nand split in two.\nWe will travel to Mars\neven as folks on Earth\nare still ripping open potato chip\nbags with their teeth.\nWhy? I don\u2019t have the time or intelligence\nto make all the connections,\nlike my friend Gordon\n(this is a true story)\nwho, having grown up in Braintree, Massachusetts,\nhad never pictured a brain snagged in a tree\nuntil I brought it up.\nHe\u2019d never broken the name down to its parts.\nBy then it was too late.\nHe had moved to Coral Gables.\nThe hill out my window is still looking beautiful,\nsuffused in a kind of gold national park light,\nand it seems to say,\nI\u2019m sorry the world could not possibly\nuse another poem about Orpheus\nbut I\u2019m available if you\u2019re not working\non a self-portrait or anything.\nI\u2019m watching my dog have nightmares,\ntwitching and whining on the office floor,\nand I try to imagine what beast\nhas cornered him in the meadow\nwhere his dreams are set.\nI\u2019m just letting the day be what it is:\na place for a large number of things\nto gather and interact \u2014\nnot even a place but an occasion,\na reality for real things.\nFriends warned me not to get too psychedelic\nor religious with this piece:\n\u201cthey won\u2019t accept it if it\u2019s too psychedelic\nor religious,\u201d but these are valid topics\nand I\u2019m the one with the dog twitching on the floor,\npossibly dreaming of me,\nthat part of me that would beat a dog\nfor no good reason,\nno reason that a dog could see.\nI am trying to get at something so simple\nthat I have to talk plainly\nso the words don\u2019t disfigure it,\nand if it turns out that what I say is untrue,\nthen at least let it be harmless\nlike a leaky boat in the reeds\nthat is bothering no one.\nI can\u2019t trust the accuracy of my own memories,\nmany of them having blended with sentimental\ntelephone and margarine commercials,\nplainly ruined by Madison Avenue,\nthough no one seems to call the advertising world\n\u201cMadison Avenue\u201d anymore. Have they moved?\nI need an update on this.\nBut first I have some business to take care of.\nI walked out to the hill behind our house\nwhich looks positively Alaskan today,\nand it would be easier to explain this\nif I had a picture to show you,\nbut I was with our young dog\nand he was running through the tall grass\nlike running through the tall grass\nis all of life together,\nuntil a bird calls or he finds a beer can\nand that thing fills all the space in his head.\nYou see,\nhis mind can only hold one thought at a time\nand when he finally hears me call his name\nhe looks up and cocks his head.\nFor a single moment\nmy voice is everything:\nSelf-portrait at 28.\n",

Their mouths look like coin slots.\nA neighbor plays keyboards in a local cover band.\nPreparing for an engagement at the high school prom,\nthey pack their equipment in silence.\nLast night they played the Police Academy Ball and all\nthe officers slow-danced with target range silhouettes.\nThis year the theme for the prom is the Tetragrammaton.\nA yellow Corsair sails through the disco parking lot\nand swaying palms presage the lot of young libertines.\nInside the car a young lady wears a corsage of bullet-sized rodents.\nHer date, the handsome cornerback, stretches his talons over the\nmolded steering wheel.\nThey park and walk into the lush starlit gardens behind the disco\njust as the band is striking up.\nTheir keen eyes and ears twitch. The other couples\nlook beautiful tonight. They stroll around listening\nto the brilliant conversation. The passionate speeches.\nClouds drift across the silverware. There is red larkspur,\nblue gum, and ivy. A boy kneels before his date.\nAnd the moon, I forgot to mention the moon.\n",

My name is...\u201d\nIt\u2019s enough to be sitting here on my porch,\nthinking about Kermit Roosevelt,\nfollowing the course of an ant,\nor walking out into the yard with a cordless phone\n           to find out she is going to be there tonight.\nOn a day like today, what looks like bad news in the distance\nturns out to be something on my contact, carports and\nwhite courtesy phones are spontaneously reappreciated\n           and random \u201cokay\u201ds ring through the backyards.\nThis morning I discovered the red tints in cola\n                     when I held a glass of it up to the light\nand found an expensive flashlight in the pocket of a winter coat\n                     I was packing away for summer.\nIt all reminds me of that moment when you take off your\nsunglasses after a long drive and realize it\u2019s earlier\nand lighter out than you had accounted for.\nYou know what I\u2019m talking about,\nand that\u2019s the kind of fellowship that\u2019s taking place in town, out in\nthe public spaces. You won\u2019t overhear anyone using the words\n\u201cdramaturgy\u201d or \u201cstate inspection\u201d today. We\u2019re too busy getting along.\nIt occurs to me that the laws are in the regions and the regions are\nin the laws, and it feels good to say this, something that I\u2019m almost\nsure is true, outside under the sun.\nThen to say it again, around friends, in the resonant voice of a\nnineteenth-century senator, just for a lark.\nThere\u2019s a shy looking fellow on the courthouse steps, holding up\na placard that says \u201cBut, I kinda liked Clinton.\u201d His head turns slowly\nas a beautiful girl walks by, holding a refrigerated bottle up against\nher flushed cheek.\nShe smiles at me and I allow myself to imagine her walking into\ntown to buy lotion at a brick pharmacy.\nWhen she gets home she\u2019ll apply it with great lingering care\nbefore moving into her parlor to play 78 records and drink gin-and-tonics\nbeside her homemade altar to James Madison.\nIn a town of this size, it\u2019s certainly possible that I\u2019ll be invited over\none night.\nIn fact I\u2019ll bet you something.\nSomewhere in the future I am remembering today. I\u2019ll bet you\nI\u2019m remembering how I walked into the park at five thirty,\nmy favorite time of day, and how I found two cold pitchers\nof just poured beer, sitting there on the bench.\nI am remembering how my friend Chip showed up\nwith a catcher\u2019s mask hanging from his belt and how I said\ngreat to see you, sit down, have a beer, how are you,\nand how he turned to me with the sunset reflecting off his\ncontacts and said, wonderful, how are you.\n",

The mystery was how\nsomeone insignificant and ordinary\nas Gertrude had redistributed \nthat weight, and reoriented\nthe magnetic poles that for us\nalways defaulted to agony.  \nShe had been our hero,\nicon of a victory that could\none day be ours if we learned\nto live as Gertrude lived: elegant\nand stoical, silencing our constant\nclamoring for relief. But now \nhere she was: testifying to victory \nor defeat? We could not tell, and that\nFucked us up. Oracular and  \nEternal was what we\u2019d\nthought she was. In possession \nof the answer. Instead,\nher image and her words\u2014 \nIt will bring you to your knees\nturned us back into ourselves.\nwhere the suffering was,\nand the mystery, and offered \nno answer but the hard shock \nof our knees knocking against \nthe earth, and the prickling burn \nof blood breaking its barrier of skin\nand starting to flow.\n",

A book one thumbs\nListlessly, till slumber comes.\nUnremembered are her bats\nCircling through the night, her cats\nCrouching in the river reeds,\nStalking gentle flesh that feeds\nBy the river brink; no more\nDoes the bugle-throated roar\nCry that monarch claws have leapt\nFrom the scabbards where they slept.\nSilver snakes that once a year\nDoff the lovely coats you wear,\nSeek no covert in your fear\nLest a mortal eye should see;\nWhat's your nakedness to me?\nHere no leprous flowers rear\nFierce corollas in the air;\nHere no bodies sleek and wet,\nDripping mingled rain and sweat,\nTread the savage measures of\nJungle boys and girls in love.\nWhat is last year's snow to me,\nLast year's anything? The tree\nBudding yearly must forget\nHow its past arose or set\u2014\nBough and blossom, flower, fruit,\nEven what shy bird with mute\nWonder at her travail there,\nMeekly labored in its hair.\nOne three centuries removed\nFrom the scenes his fathers loved,\nSpicy grove, cinnamon tree,\nWhat is Africa to me?\nSo I lie, who find no peace\nNight or day, no slight release\nFrom the unremittant beat\nMade by cruel padded feet\nWalking through my body's street.\nUp and down they go, and back,\nTreading out a jungle track.\nSo I lie, who never quite\nSafely sleep from rain at night\u2014\nI can never rest at all\nWhen the rain begins to fall;\nLike a soul gone mad with pain\nI must match its weird refrain;\nEver must I twist and squirm,\nWrithing like a baited worm,\nWhile its primal measures drip\nThrough my body, crying, \"Strip!\nDoff this new exuberance.\nCome and dance the Lover's Dance!\"\nIn an old remembered way\nRain works on me night and day.\nQuaint, outlandish heathen gods\nBlack men fashion out of rods,\nClay, and brittle bits of stone,\nIn a likeness like their own,\nMy conversion came high-priced;\nI belong to Jesus Christ,\nPreacher of humility;\nHeathen gods are naught to me.\nFather, Son, and Holy Ghost,\nSo I make an idle boast;\nJesus of the twice-turned cheek,\nLamb of God, although I speak\nWith my mouth thus, in my heart\nDo I play a double part.\nEver at Thy glowing altar\nMust my heart grow sick and falter,\nWishing He I served were black,\nThinking then it would not lack\nPrecedent of pain to guide it,\nLet who would or might deride it;\nSurely then this flesh would know\nYours had borne a kindred woe.\nLord, I fashion dark gods, too,\nDaring even to give You\nDark despairing features where,\nCrowned with dark rebellious hair,\nPatience wavers just so much as\nMortal grief compels, while touches\nQuick and hot, of anger, rise\nTo smitten cheek and weary eyes.\nLord, forgive me if my need\nSometimes shapes a human creed.\nAll day long and all night through,\nOne thing only must I do:\nQuench my pride and cool my blood,\nLest I perish in the flood.\nLest a hidden ember set\nTimber that I thought was wet\nBurning like the dryest flan,\nMelting like the merest wax,\nLest the grave restore its dead.\nNot yet has my heart or head\nIn the least way realized\nThey and I are civilized.\n",

Then let me render one by one\nThy gifts, while still they shine; some little\n        sun\nYet gilds these thighs; my coat, albeit worn,\nStill holds its colors fast; albeit torn,\nMy heart will laugh a little yet, if I\nMay win of Thee this grace, Lord: on this\n        high\nAnd sacrificial hill 'twixt earth and sky,\nTo dream still pure all that I loved, and die.\nThere is no other way to keep secure\nMy wild chimeras; grave-locked against the\n        lure\nOf Truth, the small hard teeth of worms, yet\n        less\nEnvenomed than the mouth of Truth, will\n        bless\nThem into dust and happy nothingness.\nLord, Thou art God; and I, Lord, what am I\nBut dust? With dust my place. Lord, let me\n        die.\"\nAcross the earth's warm, palpitating crust\nI flung my body in embrace; I thrust\nMy mouth into the grass and sucked the dew,\nThen gave it back in tears my anguish drew;\nSo hard I pressed against the ground, I felt\nThe smallest sandgrain like a knife, and smelt\nThe next year's flowering; all this to speed\nMy body's dissolution, fain to feed\nThe worms. And so I groaned, and spent my\n        strength\nUntil, all passion spent, I lay full length\nAnd quivered like a flayed and bleeding thing.\nSo lay till lifted on a great black wing\nThat had no mate nor flesh-apparent trunk\nTo hamper it; with me all time had sunk\nInto oblivion; when I awoke\nThe wing hung poised above two cliffs that\n        broke\nThe bowels of the earth in twain, and cleft\nThe seas apart. Below, above, to left,\nTo right, I saw what no man saw before:\nEarth, hell, and heaven; sinew, vein, and core.\nAll things that swim or walk or creep or fly,\nAll things that live and hunger, faint and die,\nWere made majestic then and magnified\nBy sight so clearly purged and deified.\nThe smallest bug that crawls was taller than\nA tree, the mustard seed loomed like a man.\nThe earth that writhes eternally with pain\nOf birth, and woe of taking back her slain,\nLaid bare her teeming bosom to my sight,\nAnd all was struggle, gasping breath, and\n        fight.\nA blind worm here dug tunnels to the light,\nAnd there a seed, racked with heroic pain,\nThrust eager tentacles to sun and rain;\nIt climbed; it died; the old love conquered me\nTo weep the blossom it would never be.\nBut here a bud won light; it burst and\n        flowered\nInto a rose whose beauty challenged,\n        \"Coward!\"\nThere was no thing alive save only I\nThat held life in contempt and longed to die.\nAnd still I writhed and moaned, \"The curse,\n        the curse,\nThan animated death, can death be worse?\"\n\"Dark child of sorrow, mine no less, what art\nOf mine can make thee see and play thy part?\nThe key to all strange things is in thy heart.\u201d\nWhat voice was this that coursed like liquid\n        fire\nAlong my flesh, and turned my hair to wire?\nI raised my burning eyes, beheld a field\nAll multitudinous with carnal yield,\nA grim ensanguined mead whereon I saw\nEvolve the ancient fundamental law\nOf tooth and talon, fist and nail and claw.\nThere with the force of living, hostile hills\nWhose clash the hemmed-in vale with clamor\n        fills,\nWith greater din contended fierce majestic\n        wills\nOf beast with beast, of man with man, in strife\nFor love of what my heart despised, for life\nThat unto me at dawn was now a prayer\nFor night, at night a bloody heart-wrung tear\nFor day again; for this, these groans\nFrom tangled flesh and interlocked bones.\nAnd no thing died that did not give\nA testimony that it longed to live.\nMan, strange composite blend of brute and\n        god,\nPushed on, nor backward glanced where last\n        he trod.\nHe seemed to mount a misty ladder flung\nPendant from a cloud, yet never gained a rung\nBut at his feet another tugged and clung.\nMy heart was still a pool of bitterness,\nWould yield nought else, nought else confess.\nI spoke (although no form was there\nTo see, I knew an ear was there to hear),\n\"Well, let them fight; they can whose flesh is\n        fair.\"\nCrisp lightning flashed; a wave of thunder\n        shook\nMy wing; a pause, and then a speaking,\n        \"Look.\"\nI scarce dared trust my ears or eyes for awe\nOf what they heard, and dread of what they\n        saw;\nFor, privileged beyond degree, this flesh\nBeheld God and His heaven in the mesh\nOf Lucifer's revolt, saw Lucifer\nGlow like the sun, and like a dulcimer\nI heard his sin-sweet voice break on the yell\nOf God's great warriors: Gabriel,\nSaint Clair and Michael, Israfel and Raphael.\nAnd strange it was to see God with His back\nAgainst a wall, to see Christ hew and hack\nTill Lucifer, pressed by the mighty pair,\nAnd losing inch by inch, clawed at the air\nWith fevered wings; then, lost beyond repair,\nHe tricked a mass of stars into his hair;\nHe filled his hands with stars, crying as he\n        fell,\n\"A star's a star although it burns in hell.\"\nSo God was left to His divinity,\nOmnipotent at that most costly fee.\nThere was a lesson here, but still the clod\nIn me was sycophant unto the rod,\nAnd cried, \"Why mock me thus? Am I a\n        god?\"\n\"One trial more: this failing, then I give\nYou leave to die; no further need to live.\u201d\nNow suddenly a strange wild music smote\nA chord long impotent in me; a note\nOf jungles, primitive and subtle, throbbed\nAgainst my echoing breast, and tom-toms\n        sobbed\nIn every pulse-beat of my frame. The din\nA hollow log bound with a python's skin\nCan make wrought every nerve to ecstasy,\nAnd I was wind and sky again, and sea,\nAnd all sweet things that flourish, being free.\nTill all at once the music changed its key.\nAnd now it was of bitterness and death,\nThe cry the lash extorts, the broken breath\nOf liberty enchained ; and yet there ran\nThrough all a harmony of faith in man,\nA knowledge all would end as it began.\nAll sights and sounds and aspects of my race\nAccompanied this melody, kept pace\nWith it; with music all their hopes and hates\nWere charged, not to be downed by all the\n        fates.\nAnd somehow it was borne upon my brain\nHow being dark, and living through the pain\nOf it, is courage more than angels have. I\n        knew\nWhat storms and tumults lashed the tree that\n        grew\nThis body that I was, this cringing I\nThat feared to contemplate a changing sky,\nThis that I grovelled, whining, \"Let me die,\"\nWhile others struggled in Life's abattoir.\nThe cries of all dark people near or far\nWere billowed over me, a mighty surge\nOf suffering in which my puny grief must\n        merge\nAnd lose itself; I had no further claim to urge\nFor death; in shame I raised my dust-grimed\n        head,\nAnd though my lips moved not, God knew I\n        said,\n\"Lord, not for what I saw in flesh or bone\nOf fairer men; not raised on faith alone;\nLord, I will live persuaded by mine own.\nI cannot play the recreant to these;\nMy spirit has come home, that sailed the\n        doubtful seas.\"\nWith the whiz of a sword that severs space,\nThe wing dropped down at a dizzy pace,\nAnd flung me on my hill flat on my face;\nFlat on my face I lay defying pain,\nGlad of the blood in my smallest vein,\nAnd in my hands I clutched a loyal dream,\nStill spitting fire, bright twist and coil and\n        gleam,\nAnd chiselled like a hound's white tooth.\n\"Oh, I will match you yet,\" I cried, \"to truth.\"\n        spurned,\nGlad even unto tears; I laughed aloud; I\n        turned\nUpon my back, and though the tears for joy\n        would run,\nMy sight was clear; I looked and saw the\n        rising sun.\n        spurned,\nGlad even unto tears; I laughed aloud; I\n        turned\nUpon my back, and though the tears for joy\n        would run,\nMy sight was clear; I looked and saw the\n        rising sun.\n",

The puma stalking its prey.\nThese, too, want ease and a tender animal in the mouth\nto take their hunger. An offering, one hopes, \nmade quickly, and without much suffering.\nThe chair mourns an angry sitter. The lamp, a scalded moth.\nA table, the weight of years of argument.\nWe know this, though we forget.\nNot the shark nor the tiger, fanged as they are.\nNor the worm, content in its windowless world\nof soil and stone. Not the stone, resting in its riverbed.\nThe riverbed, gazing up at the stars.\nLeast of all, the stars, ensconced in their canopy,\nlooking down at all of us\u2014 their offspring\u2014\nscattered so far beyond reach.\n",

She designed the house so that it would never burn.\n6.      The rock patio has a pyramid-shaped staircase that leads up and over the edge.\n7.      Left unattended, I slid every window latch open, shimmied through sliding doors.\n8.      You could hear the red-breasted robins singing from the second floor.\n9.      The silver painted wallpaper came off on my fingertips.\n10.    What they thought was a guest room was actually her office.\n11.    When the state cataloged the house, everyone forgot she was a writer.\n12.     It never burned.\n13.     Bays and oaks move closer to the house. (Hear their leaves whisper?)\n14.     Though they'll cover the fountain in the sun-filled dining room, its waters will keep broadcasting to future visitors.\n",

When I woke up,\nI felt it. A twitching in my teeth.\nThe rumble of a nearby rapture. I opened the blinds\nand a pack of white women were wailing down Maple,\ncrying into potholes, writhing in the street\nlike worms. One saw me, then the wails grew\nand turned into a chorus of sorry sorry sorry\nso sorry we\u2019re sorry and I wished Yemoja\nwould sling an ocean out my throat.

Sing, swallow!\nGrasses are in the lane, \n   Buds and flowers will follow.\nWoods shall ring, blithe and gay,\n   With bird-trill and twitter,\nThough the skies weep to-day, \n   And the winds are bitter. \nThough deep call unto deep\n   As calls the thunder, \nAnd white the billows leap\n   The tempest under;\nSoftly the waves shall come\n   Up the long, bright beaches, \nWith dainty, flowers of foam\n   And tenderest speeches\u2026\nAfter the wintry pain, \n   And the long, long sorrow, \nSing, heart!\u2014for thee again\n   Joy comes with the morrow.\n",

Bull saw us all as threat\u2014the lot\nof us, the endless stream that poured\nout of our church and onto the street.\nWe sang and we held hands.

But let\u2019s get back to that bullet,\nstopped by an unequal force, confronted\nby mere droplets corralled into sinister\nduty. I heard those dogs before I saw them\n\u2014growls, snarls\u2014trained to see nothing\nof my size, my gentleness. I knew the water\nin the air just before it launched me airborne,\nramming me into disbelief, then tree trunk,\nthen a crowded mass of children\u2019s hips and legs.\nI was six and my song ordained that I be seen\nas change, or silenced, arrested and contained.\nI had lost my shoes and my blue hair ribbons.\nI was wearing a muddy crinoline and learned\nthe coolness of both iron bars and the beady\neyes of hatred, a jailor\u2019s sputum gelling\non the side of my face that I refused to touch.\n",

You were reluctant to call\n           it discovery, perhaps because you know \n           all too well what poisons gush forth\n           from that word. Or maybe you suspect \n                                                         you are not the first because you \n                                                         know there is no such thing\n                                                         as firsts. Still, you did what no \ngringo ever could: you made another world\nvisible to nosotrxs. Perchance it was HD110014C \nthat actually recognized you long before your\n                       spectroscopic lens detected her.\n                       It might even be that she had already \n                       decided to entrust you with making\n                                              her presence known to our kind.\n                                              After all, you proved yourself more\n                                              than worthy of such responsibility\nwhen you said your\nfinding was \u201cnot\nexceptional,\u201d annihilating\n                                   the misguided western patriarchal notion\n                                   of greatness too many others have used \n                                   to boost themselves since 1492. \n                                                        You even confessed your introduction \n                                                         to HD110014C\n                                                         was entirely an accident,\n           a courageous admission that eclipses\n           the bumbling arrogance of every Columbus,\n           every Cortez, every Pizarro.

I will say this and let it linger, and what I mean \nis that this is the way of poetry for me, for much of what I offer, I am sure of nothing,\nthe knowing or the outworking, but the trust of its history of resolution\u2014so that I will say, \nthis is the origin of history, and by this, I mean this small conundrum: \u201cLead us not, \nlead me not, lead them not, lead them not,\u201d And what is this were it not the way \nwe know the heavy hand of God\u2014that to pray, \u201cLead them not into temptation\u201d,\nis a kind of mercy, and to say, \u201cLead us not\u201d, is the penitence of a sinning nation \ndesperate for the lifting of the curses of contagion and plague. The subtext is the finger \npointed at the culprit.  So that what kind of father do I tell this to?  Might I have said,\n\u201cNeville, please, lead me not into temptation\u201d, what would it mean to tell my old man \nnot to lead me into temptation? Must that not be the same as a reprimand to my father, \na judgment on his propensity to fail me? \n                                                                Do you want answers?  You have come to the wrong\nplace.  I am selfish with answers. I am hoarding all answers.  Go, instead, to the prophets \nand the preachers, the soothsayers and priests, go to the pundits and the dream readers,\nto the pontiffs and kings, to the presidents and mayors, to the brokers in answers. But me, \nI hoard the secrets of my calming beauty, and I walk this road, not as a maker of questions\u2014\nthis would be a crude wickedness\u2014but with the fabric of our uncertainty, a net stretched \nacross the afternoon sky, this is beauty and in this I will trade until all music ends, and the air \ngrows crisp as airless grace. They say that if you find honey in the stomach of the baobab tree, \nyou must leave the better part for the spirit of the tree, and then share the remnant sweetness\nwith your neighbors. And what they say, among the reeds, what they say, in the arms of the trees, \nwhat they say in the shelter of the sky, that is enough for the days of terror and sorrow. Amen.\n",

At the airport, you heave the bags \nyou have stuffed to the limits of carriage \nand check them in. You have no trouble \nknowing what to do with your empty \nhands. At security, the usual stripping.\nYou surrender your body to the scan, \nthe searching sweep, as if what is dangerous \nis not what cannot be so easily detected.\nYou comply. At the gate, grateful to be \nearly, you sit with your books, plug in \ndevices that tether you to this place \nyou\u2019re meant to be leaving, that crowd \nout thoughts of arrival and its bittersweet\ncomplications. Yuh going home or just visiting,\nsomeone will ask, and you never know\nhow you will answer. You know the bones\nof your mother\u2019s brown arms will wind \naround you, her breath against your neck\nwill baptize you again in names you have \nno one to call you in the other place \nyou belong to. You know the waiting\nuntended in you will surge toward her,\nand you know something else will sink, \nsulk itself into a familiar, necessary sleep.\nYou know yourself now only as the ocean \nknows this island\u2014always pulling away, \nalways, always, returning.\n",

Brought sweet tea, \nbrought postcards and stamps. For four years, each day, something.\nStone did not become apple. War did not become peace. \nYet joy still stays joy. Sequins stay sequins. Words still bespangle, bewilder. \nToday, I woke without answer. \nThe day answers, unpockets a thought from a friend\ndon't despair of this falling world, not yet\ndidn't it give you the asking\n",

We skirt around it, a kindness.  \nIt disgusts you, the depth of this need,  \nlike the slick walls of a well.   \nYour bones ache most when held. \nEventually, you\u2019ll have to stop impersonating a skimmed stone.  \nThere are other ways of parting. \nYou annotate Barthes annotating Keats, half in love with easeful death. \nOver-identify until you are light-headed, until you remember a hot, loud classroom.  \nBreathless bluetooth blues, a free school meal in your belly, \nthe easy cruelty of teachers at under-performing schools,  \nso unlike their counterparts in the movies,  \nthose loose-tied English teachers who promise you \na world so much bigger than this. So much easier than this. \nChipped neon nail polish competing against your prized set of highlighters,  \nyou mistake a poem for a blueprint. First the odes, then the Jane Campion film.  \nThat night, you dreamt of lavender fields, bruised eyelids,  \nthe shape of Rome\u2019s dying sunlight on a poet\u2019s grave.  \nhis friends contextualised their grief, added the rest.  \nThis Grave contains all that was mortal, of a YOUNG ENGLISH POET,  \nwho on his Death Bed, in the Bitterness of his heart,  \nat the Malicious Power of his enemies,  \ndesired these words to be Engraven on his Tomb Stone.  \nYou think of how casually our bodies are overruled by kin, by blood,  \nby heartaches disguised as homelands.  \nHow you can count the years you have lived for yourself on one hand.  \nHistory is the hammer. You are the nail. \nIn another dream, your mother is barefoot and young,  \nwearing a scarf the colour of a wound. By Fontana del Moro, a Moor adrift  \non a conch shell leans over her shoulder,  \nas she unpeels her wet dress from her legs.  \nUnmoored, she laughs at this new country calling itself an old one.  \nThese fictions she tosses like loose coins.  \nWe don\u2019t dare dip our hands further than they can reach.  \nHer gold bracelets slide down the silk flags of her wrists.  \nNightly, you strive to write a loose translation of this. \nArterial blood is theatrical, like the desire for a time before your time.  \nThe world will not stop when you do, or even before.  \nYes, being the one who survived, the one who made it to this side,  \nis a full-time job.  \nBut no-one asked you to take it.  \nDiaspora is witnessing a murder without getting blood on your shirt.  \nYour body is the evidence of its absence.  \nOf course, there are other definitions.  \nNamely, a freshly scraped scalp, dome of your rock,  \nthe inevitability of fajr and late-night texts,  \neach lie about how good the exchange rate was.  \nThat time he cried telling you the story of why his family had left Sweden,  \nthe image of a younger brother held underwater by wild-eyed classmates.  \nDefinitions, like flags, lay claim to what has always existed.  \nFor now, these will do. You can\u2019t speak for the future.  \nIt barely speaks for you.  \nPick a mask and ask me to wear it. You only know love like this,  \nan interpretation you can\u2019t outrun.  \nA footnote to haunt the page.  \n",

My big nose\nNestled in her sassafras.\nAt attention, we round\nEach other out. At ease, \nHer peach is a galaxy.\nNow and later is a square\nI quietly hold on my tongue,\nMy mouth an empty gesture. \nSpaced out between her legs, \nI am an astronaut.\nThe gravity of my offense\nAdds up to a rational number.\nWhen the heavens are free\nFrom light, I sit desire on my lap.\nShe is stardust; And I, \nAs it were, am impossible.  \nWhen she asks for space\nShe is the future. When she\nAsks for a room, it is the end. \nI place before her chutes,\nLadders, and whatever else\nMight fall from the sky.\n",

  "text": "The house was built,  \nBrick by brick, pane by pane,  \nInitially withstanding winds,  \nThe force of a hurricane. \nBut over time, the faults are found  \nAs storm after storm  \nAssails, the craftsmanship outdated,  \nIn need of reform. \nThe windows break, one by one,  \nUnder the weight of wrongs, the structure strains, \nUntil one day fire catches,  \nAnd only the foundation of good intentions remains.  \nWhile easiest would be to walk,  \nTo abandon, moving on to rebuild,  \nThe value is seen by those who have called it \nHome, desires to be fulfilled.  \nRemembering the mistakes,  \nMaintaining the hope of freedom,  \nHand in hand, we work,  \nEntering a new season.  \nThe work is not complete until  \nThe walls protect all who live there,  \nNo exceptions. Abandonment of all  \nUnnecessary despair.  \nA job led by all, not by one,  \nWe work long days turn long nights.  \nThe creation of our hands  \nProving more than surface level acknowledgment of rights.  \nThe past is not buried  \nBut underlies \nWhat we have transformed  \nBefore our eyes.\n",

  "text": "When I picture Robert, he is in the Public Garden,\nwatching setting suns, like the ill-fated king, turn all to gold.\nRobert with the swans. Robert under the statue of Washington.\nRobert amid the tulips. Without a childhood\nhome, I made for myself a house of orchids, of sewer grates\nwith fishes on them, of forsythia and maple trees.\nOf this I am sure: when Robert crossed the bridge\nbetween Boston and Cambridge, he saw Poseidon.\nIn late summer, he could tell that underneath\nthe sailboats is a god, mighty and to be feared.\nIn midwinter, he alone knew the ice\ncould not long contain that god.\nIn the pipes in his home, he heard the gurgle of illness.\nI smell illness in the riotous orchid blooms.\nWhat are midnight trees?\nI think that once I knew one such tree,\nif it is the kind owls gather on nightly\nto fight, barking,\neyes dim with bloodlust and the hiss of feathers.\nI built for myself a house of orchids, with a cave underneath,\na cave shaped into an armory\nbrimming with tarantula hawks, giant sparrow bees,\nand admiral butterflies.\nIn place of stalactites hang treeless,\ninextricable roots.\nO sacred receptacle of my joys.\nThe day I first learned the word argonaut,\nI wrote it in a poem. I searched the seas for one.\nI searched the skies. I searched a painting.\nIn the painting, I found the word spears, which I drove slowly\ninto my father\u2019s ribs. He I eulogized and he I resurrected,\nreaching again for the spears. I have seen\ncountless full moons fail. Each of them hollowed,\nflooding heartfirst the craw-faced light, the bracken\nunderneath. Then, the sound of a wounded owl,\na soft, sudden darkness in my throat. O, how this villainy.\nIn mourning, the owls are replaced by hawks.\nFrom one angle, broad-winged hawks\nseem to have two pairs of hollow eyes.\nWe are looking for you, say the kettles of satellites\nto the humans lost, to the plane\ndisappeared, to what lives thirty miles below\nthe surface of Enceladus. On this morning in April,\nHaixun 01, Ocean Shield, and HMS Echo hear a thump\nthat sounds like the colors inside an oyster shell.\nThe frequency of the noise can make a heart\nstop. Anxious as seaweed, over the sides of the ships\ncreep hordes of trembling locators.\nThe satellites stare with breath hitching in their throats.\nBetween the wine-colored hull of Ocean Shield and Enceladus\nlies eight times the distance between Earth and the sun.\nThirty miles below the surface of that geyser-ridden, tiger-striped\nSaturnian moon lies life, report the satellites.\nThe hawks steel their two pairs of eyes up\ntoward alien oceans on other planets.\nWhat I am is all that I can carry, wrote Deborah.\nWhat can I carry? All that I caught I left behind,\nall that I missed, I carried.\nThe hawks are not looking\ntoward alien oceans. I am.\nI am looking, too, to alien men and women.\nI picture hurtling into them, by turn, to serve my lust.\nI picture us bent sideways, impaled,\ncontorted and screaming. I picture\nthe different shades of a moan.\nThe word bed fills the four eyes in my mind\nwith the color gold, gold of the ill-fated king\nand the Garden sunset, gold glinting in a decaying tooth,\ngoldenrod, a haze of pollen, the dragon\u2019s treasure,\na long necklace of many fine gold chains\nreaching down to a woman\u2019s hips.\nYoung man walks down to the river\ndown to the river of gold.\nYoung man walks down to the river\ndown to the river and drowns.\nIn the word bed also joyously wail\nbed the color of ashen near death, bed the fleshly color\nof bodies broken for good, bed the color blue\nof heart-stopped lips. O, here I lift this one hand\nup to heaven. The ghosts of the poisoned dogs\nlive in the piano. The ghost of my mother, still living,\nlives in her excised tumor and staghorn kidney stone.\nThe ghost of my ability to love without grief, still living,\nlives in this poem. All my pockets filled with stones\nin the river I\u2019ll be found. Why, then, I am the devil\u2019s dam\u2014\ndangle me from a cliff, twelve thousand feet above sea.\nO, speak with possibilities. Build me a skin\nof glass to cover the Grand Canyon,\nthrow me on it. Summon a thousand wilding mares,\nrestrain them with massive chains, foot-long links\nof hardened steel. When the chains buck\nfrom fracture, let the mares stampede the glass,\nbid them trample my body.\nWatch, from a great distance, as the glass cracks.\nWatch us beasts entangle. Watch me take a hoof\nto the mouth. To the skull. To the groin.\nHear us squeal, and bark, and howl,\ncalling out, as wretches do, to failing life.\nWhen at last we one thousand and one blood-filled creatures\nreach the bottom of the Canyon, throw yourself in.\nMy voice in your ear will tell you that you were meant to die\nlike this, a beautiful and inelegant dive onto a field of reds,\nsome bright and sun-kissed, some dark and pulp-dashed,\nyour and our blood across the burnt-orange schist.\nSee, O, see what I have done.      \nI fear neither the sight of nor the word for blood.\nHMAS Albatross has joined the search for the plane.\nIt is May now, and there is no sign of it.\nThe detritus lied. The home I made is of orchids,\nforsythia, barbed wire, and burnt metal.\nIn the bedroom I planted what I imagine\na midnight tree to be. Its roots join the treeless roots\nin the armory beneath. Ravished, my hands cut off,\nmy tongue cut out, I put my home under the wisteria,\ncraving owls at war under thick purple overhang.\nNo territory there is that is not mine.\nThe Albatross, it is mine.\nEnceladus is mine. Your innermost thigh,\nbeneath the wisteria, mine.\nPoseidon is mine, and the river between Boston and Cambridge,\nand the one that wends through Georgia, floods\ninto the Gulf. I am dreaming of a monument\nto moments colonized by theaters of the imagination.\nO monstrous. The O of a mouth without a tongue.\nThe O of two pairs of lips clasped,\nstarving on one another. Horns and cry of hounds.\nThe ballet in my deadly standing eye\nis the arrow\u2019s flight into the neck, the horses\u2019 tumble into the canyon.\nA nation\u2019s search for a single tiger\nwith quills in its neck. A spilt cloud of felled bees.\nThe elephant\u2019s horror in the flock of red-billed birds,\nfeathered locusts who from their first breath form\ntrembling caverns with their mouths, their aggregate force\nsnapping branches off trees. The orchestra plays low drumbeats,\na single singer carving the melody.\nDo not, I pray, promise me\nan untroubled lake. Take me instead\nto the rivers with vengeful gods\nunder steaming and frozen waters.\nTake me instead for the stag, the rifle, and the hunter.\nPromise me unending days in which I can picture,\nthen picture again, a fire whirl,\nthe slowness of the sea drinking\na ferry or a plane, the gasps of air bubbles\naround carapaces, the moons of Saturn.\nI myself am hells, and I prize them\nas if they were the rarest blooms.\nPromise me I will always reach again for spears,\nawait the horses on the glass\nabove the gaping, hollow O of the earth.\nALL IS LOST. FLEE THIS HOUSE.\nSo chants James\u2019s Ouija.\nor perhaps in the palace of time\nour lives are a circular stair and i am turning,\nwrites Lucille\u2019s ghost-guided hand. Always in my mouth\nI hold the head of an axe with its bit at the back\nof my throat. O heavens, can you hear a man groan?\nHere nothing breeds but we fazed and hungry. O wondrous thing.\nWorlds such as this were not thought possible to exist,\nwrites the astronomer. It is June.\nDeep beneath those golden waves\nof the river I\u2019ll be found.\nMy sister has joined the list of those I mourn.\nHer ghost lives in each powder-winged moth.\nIn the ballet, the stage fills with a troupe of dancers in dusty gold skirts,\nshoes asphyxiation blue, hair the tones of flesh.\nCenter stage are six dancers who wear only red,\nmoving in unison\nso they throb as one bloodied yolk.\nThe troupe around them shudders\nas though in blissful death throes.\nThe single singer quiets. The orchestra\nbreaks down its instruments.\nFor my brethren slain\nI ask a sacrifice,\nO barbarous, beastly villains\nlike myself.\nDie. Die saying please,\ndie longing, die helpless,\ndie with your eyes fixed\nto the most treacherous side\nof a mountain, to newborn stars,\nto planes not found.\nDie with your throat stuffed,\nso that each moment hereafter\nis a dream of a gasp.\nDie, so that my midnight tree might grow\nnew branches, die, like a sapling struck by lightning\nin an ash-ridden and still smoldering field,\ndie amid the tulips, die smelling the orchids I grow,\ndie in the mass of horses in a pied flock of shrieking birds.\nFrom the oceans creatures great and small\ntake to the land. From the land\neach parachuted seed\ntakes to the sky.\nFrom within my armory\ncomes a scent melodious and unearthly.\nA strain of moths, black, flies as though sewn\neach to each at the wing. Their flight path\nblooms dark into the gray air\nlike a print from a silvered glass plate.\nSoon we will learn our bodies are formed\nof dead stars, so that if we made incisions\nfrom breastbone to rectum, the caves within\nwould reveal themselves to house celestial ash.\nAs the stag, I fear the mouth of the rifle.\nAs the rifle, I point my mouth, deadly, toward you.\nAs the hunter, I execute myself so I may feast.\nWorlds such as this were not thought possible to exist.\nMy lord, I aim a mile beyond the honeyed moon.\n",

I once got to see inside of my own lower abdomen. Did you know there is a galaxy there? I have photographs to prove it.\n      What things in our world still attract you most? \nMy veins make azalea roots that teem with messages. There are lights whose names I don\u2019t know. Malignancies are moons. There\u2019s gold on the ocean shores. Planets made of other planets, growing into one another to rewrite the old rules about space and about time. I saw it all, through the eye within the eye. Someday, I\u2019ll show you.\n      What would you like to clarify for our world about your life? \nDaily existence, mine included, was nothing short of improbable. \n      Do you wish to return again? \nFoucault once wrote, \u201cThe venomous heart of things and men is, at bottom, what I\u2019ve always tried to expose.\u201d \n      Is there a message you would like to give to our world? \nRilke once wrote, \u201cYou must change your life.\u201d \n      Is there anything that you wouldn\u2019t mind saying that would help assure your friends that you are you? \nWhatever I have loved, I have taken its name in vain.\n",

  "text": "On the beach and the beach in Chicago means a more urban situation than I\u2019ve ever\nheld two children played in sand or I dreamt I was in Malden, seeing what Malden\nwas, to feel there. I was overweight and swimming in my body. There were other\nchildren in the neighborhood I spent time with each day. We would go in a pack to\nthe corner store to buy candy. My favorites were a goop I squeezed from a tube and\npastel yellow and blue droplets in a grid on wax. I missed my father. I ate wax in my\nimpatience. We smashed dry ramen noodles with our hands while the bag was still\nclosed. We were sealed with the moment. Not looking down from above, not some\nfeet out ahead but flush with perception. In each music, a trace. My uncle owned a\nphotography shop near Les Cayes, where he developed film and made shirts and mugs\nwith people\u2019s faces on them. When he shot himself, no one explained why someone\nmight do that. Where does anyone get their inspiration? In writer\u2019s block, deep mind\ntries to keep surface mind safe, which creates a mutating form of hunger. Something\naround the corner. The changeable velocities of thought break barrier. I will not run\nuntil it\u2019s time. My uncle\u2019s mother, the day he died, had heard of his male lover. My\nuncle and his wife had just married. They\u2019d conceived a child. My uncle transferred\nhis remaining funds into his eldest son\u2019s bank account. The present moment can be\nyour mother, whether or not your mother was trying to hurt you. In Malden, on the\nhood of Bob\u2019s car out in front of the house, the phenomenon of clouds moved me.\nDecades later, in front of a mirror, I see my body for the first time. A tension behind\nmy eyes passes, as if my reflection had been made of clay and someone pushed it\ninto a shape I could see and understand.\n",

I sold the\nhouse behind which my\nson and I once planted such an acorn and\neven enclosed\nit in a pathetic\nring of prefabricated fencing\nI fought counter-clockwise\nagainst the coil to\nunspool off a metal roll like a robot\nfabric bolt to\nshield it from the orphan\nfawns.

But this is\nan American transition of \npower. Don\u2019t look away.\nI don\u2019t want to end\nthis poem bleeding but the wasp does eat the\nwasp, and up through\nthe top of her head like\nthe goddess she is, enters the hell-\nscape.

  "author": "Robert Frost",
  "text": "What tree may not the fig be gathered from?\nThe grape may not be gathered from the birch?\nIt's all you know the grape, or know the birch.\nAs a girl gathered from the birch myself\nEqually with my weight in grapes, one autumn,\nI ought to know what tree the grape is fruit of.\nI was born, I suppose, like anyone,\nAnd grew to be a little boyish girl\nMy brother could not always leave at home.\nBut that beginning was wiped out in fear\nThe day I swung suspended with the grapes,\nAnd was come after like Eurydice\nAnd brought down safely from the upper regions;\nAnd the life I live now's an extra life\nI can waste as I please on whom I please.\nSo if you see me celebrate two birthdays,\nAnd give myself out of two different ages,\nOne of them five years younger than I look-\nOne day my brother led me to a glade\nWhere a white birch he knew of stood alone,\nWearing a thin head-dress of pointed leaves,\nAnd heavy on her heavy hair behind,\nAgainst her neck, an ornament of grapes.\nGrapes, I knew grapes from having seen them last year.\nOne bunch of them, and there began to be\nBunches all round me growing in white birches,\nThe way they grew round Leif the Lucky's German;\nMostly as much beyond my lifted hands, though,\nAs the moon used to seem when I was younger,\nAnd only freely to be had for climbing.\nMy brother did the climbing; and at first\nThrew me down grapes to miss and scatter\nAnd have to hunt for in sweet fern and hardhack;\nWhich gave him some time to himself to eat,\nBut not so much, perhaps, as a boy needed.\nSo then, to make me wholly self-supporting,\nHe climbed still higher and bent the tree to earth\nAnd put it in my hands to pick my own grapes.\n'Here, take a tree-top, I'll get down another.\nHold on with all your might when I let go.'\nI said I had the tree. It wasn't true.\nThe opposite was true. The tree had me.\nThe minute it was left with me alone\nIt caught me up as if I were the fish\nAnd it the fishpole. So I was translated\nTo loud cries from my brother of 'Let go!\nDon't you know anything, you girl? Let go!'\nBut I, with something of the baby grip\nAcquired ancestrally in just such trees\nWhen wilder mothers than our wildest now\nHung babies out on branches by the hands\nTo dry or wash or tan, I don't know which,\n(You'll have to ask an evolutionist)-\nI held on uncomplainingly for life.\nMy brother tried to make me laugh to help me.\n'What are you doing up there in those grapes?\nDon't be afraid. A few of them won't hurt you.\nI mean, they won't pick you if you don't them.'\nMuch danger of my picking anything!\nBy that time I was pretty well reduced\nTo a philosophy of hang-and-let-hang.\n'Now you know how it feels,' my brother said,\n'To be a bunch of fox-grapes, as they call them,\nThat when it thinks it has escaped the fox\nBy growing where it shouldn't-on a birch,\nWhere a fox wouldn't think to look for it-\nAnd if he looked and found it, couldn't reach it-\nJust then come you and I to gather it.\nOnly you have the advantage of the grapes\nIn one way: you have one more stem to cling by,\nAnd promise more resistance to the picker.'\nOne by one I lost off my hat and shoes,\nAnd still I clung. I let my head fall back,\nAnd shut my eyes against the sun, my ears\nAgainst my brother's nonsense; 'Drop,' he said,\n'I'll catch you in my arms. It isn't far.'\n(Stated in lengths of him it might not be.)\n'Drop or I'll shake the tree and shake you down.'\nGrim silence on my part as I sank lower,\nMy small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo strings.\n'Why, if she isn't serious about it!\nHold tight awhile till I think what to do.\nI'll bend the tree down and let you down by it.'\nI don't know much about the letting down;\nBut once I felt ground with my stocking feet\nAnd the world came revolving back to me,\nI know I looked long at my curled-up fingers,\nBefore I straightened them and brushed the bark off.\nMy brother said: 'Don't you weigh anything?\nTry to weigh something next time, so you won't\nBe run off with by birch trees into space.'\nIt wasn't my not weighing anything\nSo much as my not knowing anything-\nMy brother had been nearer right before.\nI had not taken the first step in knowledge;\nI had not learned to let go with the hands,\nAs still I have not learned to with the heart,\nAnd have no wish to with the heart-nor need,\nThat I can see. The mind-is not the heart.\nI may yet live, as I know others live,\nTo wish in vain to let go with the mind-\nOf cares, at night, to sleep; but nothing tells me\nThat I need learn to let go with the heart.\n",

  "text": "Though no word called me, I looked again. \nEach wave of supposition hammered against the black wall. \nSometimes meaning, like an expiration date, is blurred. \nThen emptiness takes a bow, extending its invitation. \nLike that interval between the performance and the bravos. \nWhat was there before it dropped away? Was there ever anything beyond this lingering, felt presence? \nErosional debris piles up in a rift valley. \nAs the world pours into me, I pour into the broken word. \nSuggestions, you come to realize, will be dispensed in installments. The poor and the brutalized. A prayer bruise. \nIf letters act as synapses, you become a neurotransmitter, conducting the message between them. Trans latus. Carried across. A form of translation. \nBut what detonation blew these letters apart? \nCaesura: a gap between words. Mind the gap. \nYet it\u2019s precisely what\u2019s missing that beckons us. \nWhen we read, what transpires but a yearning between letters? \nThe b is all that\u2019s left of bitterness. The p introduces pain. \nLike opening the door only to be handed a summons. \nWhere the house previously stood, now a wind blows. \nThough its first and last plank held, the bridge plunged into the ravine. Given up, left behind with a terrible longing. \nOr thrown overboard and drowned in the middle passage. \nThe p and b are testaments of survivors. \nThe bodies of letters lying apart from their trauma. \nCells on opposite sides of a wound draw near and begin to merge. Phantom limb. Though what is absent speaks. \nAs I imagine what is nowhere to be found, my own substance grows porous, my life more elusive. \nA glyph, a provocation, and you respond. Art blossoms in the mind. Hey abyss, you still don\u2019t possess all of me. \nBringing about this call and response. \nHow to cure a phantom limb with a mirror? Let yourself see what is there.\n",

  "text": "to see a deer drink from a pool.\nI climbed into the hills above\nBerkeley, one step at a time.\nI went to Prince Edward Island\nwhere Anne of Green Gables\u2019 face\nis on the license plate. A hawk\nor a condor flew over our house.\nI bought a carton of smokes\nat the duty free shop in Anchorage.\nTook a seconal in Frankfurt\nand woke up in New York.\nI bothered my friends with my troubles;\nI was never (not) alone. I postponed\npleasure until it was almost gone.\nI stared out over the North Sea,\nwaiting for rain. I wandered\nthrough the red light district in Amsterdam\nin the middle of night. I rode on\nthe back of a motorcycle over a mountain\non Christmas Eve.\nI floated on my back in the ocean\nat Maui. Stared out the window of\nmy hotel room over the rooftops of\nFlorence. Took LSD in Paris and sat\non a bench in the Luxembourg Gardens.\nRented a hotel room in Liverpool\nbut couldn\u2019t sleep.\nI missed my flight from Madrid to Lisbon.\nFound an apartment on the Panhandle\nand drank tea in Golden Gate Park.\nI was caught stealing at Safeway\u2014I could never\nreturn. A Chinese acupuncturist came to\nmy house when I threw out my back\nand couldn\u2019t move. I woke up in an apartment\non 5th Street and listened to the roosters\ncrow on someone\u2019s roof. I visited her\nin her house overlooking the ocean and she\nlet me in. I put out my hand to touch you,\nbut the bed was empty.\nI wheeled a stroller down an icy New\nEngland street. Waited under a canopy\nin the rain, but she never came. I stood\nin front of a classroom with paint stains\non my shoes. Called the suicide hotline,\nbut no one answered.\nI dropped everything I was doing\nand ran into the street. Drove\na car with faulty transmission until\na fire started under the hood. I ate\nIndian food on a balcony in Capetown.\nI sang karaoke in a bar in Tibet.\nSomething I meant to say comes back\nto haunt me in my sleep. I turn\nthe key in the lock and call your\nname. Her face appears, out of nowhere,\nmaking a shadow on the page. There\u2019s\nonly one stone and it weighs a ton.\n",

A Pepsi \n2-liter. Crunch bars. Cans of Cactus Cooler, \nmaybe. The lonely monster of desire bent us \naway from boyhood, made it something small \nthat we wanted to toss rocks at. \n                                                    Rolls of Oreos \nin those pockets. Enough Doublemint gum \nto anchor friends on a green recess field. A few\nsheets of temporary tattoos to offer in class \nwhile Mrs. Hawkins continued her lesson \non the Gold Rush. \n                               I can see those pockets \npomegranate when pulled apart: a bloom \nof endings across the Market Spot parking lot \nas he tried to run. Bomb Pop ice cream bars, \nor the cartoon kind with gumballs for eyes, \noozing out. \n                   Look, I am talking about collapse. \nAs always. The rest of the poem wants to go \nlike this: I don\u2019t know what happened \nto Martin Rodriguez. He never came back\nto school. But the truth is he returned to class \nthe next day. \n                     We stood in a circle, laughing \nabout what he took until the day Manny \ngot caught smoking weed. Then we talked \nabout that until someone\u2019s cousin got shot \nafter school by the computer lab. We played \nOregon Trail on Thursdays. None of us \ncould ever cross the river. I kept dying \nof snake bite. \n                       We got older and painted walls \nfor different crews. We became enemies, me \nand Martin, drawing exes over each other. We \nturned into no one, and then, \n                                                finally, we became \nfathers. I saw him, years later, with his son. \nWe crossed each other on the street. Both of us \nnodded and kept on moving toward the sidewalk. \nSo many years collapsing into each other, \nI thought. \n                  Someone has changed the sign \nin front of the store. But if I say Market Spot\ntoday, the homie points to where we watched \nthe cashier jump the counter and snatch Martin \ninto the air, splicing it with sugar. The sharp kick \nof a boy\u2019s legs. A body jolted into enough quiet \nthat police were called. Officers with notepads, \n                the cashier waving flies away from his face.\n",

Why not also seduce the foreigner who implores nativity if loneliness can be broken and shared?\nWhen Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical debuts on Broadway in April of 1968, it becomes the first production to include a nude scene with its entire cast.\nAround the same time, Star Trek has popularized the phrase, Where no man has gone before.\nOur bodies contain elements of outer space. So that when we\u2019re naked we are gazing at the universe.\nThe night of my second panic attack, after getting released from the hospital and determined to change my mental health\u2019s course, I dream of a nebula in the shape of an octopus, holding an astronaut in each tentacle. From my perspective, the cosmonauts feed on all my arms.\nNo more falsehoods or derisions. Golden living dreams of visions. Mystic crystal revelation and the mind's true liberation.\nIn the Age of Aquarius, give or take, plurality overtakes singularity. History becomes bored by its self-referentialism. Triangles burrow into single lines. Equal signs collapse on the spikes of other equal signs.\nIn the Age of Aquarius, give or take, we give birth to information and information delivers us. I make a fist and my fist speaks in four languages. Letters enter me and suddenly I experience flavors few before me have.\nIn the Age of Aquarius, give or take, gender is a tree is a building is a cloud. It is anything that hasn\u2019t been said.

The ice sheets will melt.\nThings will get ugly. The only way to leave\nwill be to buy a ticket. Tickets will be priced at exactly\nthe amount that can be accrued\nby abandoning basic humanity.\nThe index will show how you came by your fortune:            \nIf you murdered, trafficked or exploited the vulnerable,\nstole, embezzled, poisoned, cheated, swindled,\nor otherwise subdued nature to come by wealth\ngreat enough to afford passage to the new earth;\nif your ancestors did these things and you\u2019ve done nothing\nto benefit from their crimes yet do nothing to atone\nthrough returning inherited wealth to the greater good\nyou shall be granted passage. It was agreed.\nThe meek shall stay, the powerful shall leave.\nAnd it all shall start again.\nThe meek shall inherit the earth,\nand what shall we do with it,\nbut set about putting aside our meekness?\n",

  "text": "At first, I spoke to my neighbor daily, in part because of the weather\n(he could still sit out on bench)\nin part because of vice\n(I was chain-smoking and he\u2019d shout for one when I passed)\nbut this stopped, in part because of trust\n(he did not believe I was smoking less and resented the imagined lie)\nin part because of routes\n(at first I added 15 minutes to my commute to walk north, past his apartment, towards 6th avenue, and up through the park, as this removes 25-50% of my anxiety, but now that I have lived here half a year, I find myself incapable of waking up early enough to permit this easy remedy, so I walk the other, faster direction)\nand in part because of novelty\n(having covered introductions, we now tend to say only \u201chello\u201d when I do pass).\nI have a sense of what he looks like, due to this regularity,\nbut I could not describe his building.\nSomeone I was hoping to kiss informed me\nthat it\u2019s easy to remember\nimages (all you have to do, they said, is take\na lesson from a children\u2019s book, one in which a girl could\nremember anything she wanted by saying \u201cclick,\u201d\nand imagining she held a camera). Later, distracted\non my walk home by the kiss\u2019s memory, which came\neasily because my eyes had been closed for it, I took a wrong\nturn and struggled to find my building\non an unfamiliar street. That\u2019s why I\u2019m studying:\nThere is my own blue bicycle; the round planter to the left\nof the steps I use to enter, which the downstairs neighbor keeps\ntidy\u2014cutting back the plants that don\u2019t stay green\nin the winter, for example, but keeping the heartier cabbages\nwatered\u2014though I have never seen her do this work;\nsomewhere between two and five pride flags,\nsome of which are there year round while others\nappear only in June; a fire hydrant; the windows\nof the apartment that face mine, through which I see my least\nfavorite bookshelves: they look mildly expensive\nand comprise a set of intersecting diamonds, making the books\nhard to remove and reshelf since they are all piled at slants;\nsome scaffolding that seems to attract unhappy couples mid-fight;\none set of table and chairs; a house that frequently puts books\nor toys or clothes out on the sidewalk for free. I know that\nthere are two or more remarkable sculptures, but only\nbecause I remember remarking: one might be of a silver\nbust of a woman, maybe an angel or a pop star, while others\nare definitely at the base of the railings to the steps across the street, but I don\u2019t\nremember now if they are dogs or birds. There is a statue of an owl\non a window ledge I can see from one chair, and it often scares me.\nNow some buildings have Christmas lights, but I couldn\u2019t say\nwhich, and that could easily lead me to turn down any other residential\nblock. There is a lilac bush immediately next door, and in May, it helped me\nidentify my building from very far away. But when we came\nto pick up our keys, I began to cry\u2014it resembles\nanother that grew in front of my childhood and I am\nsentimental. I sat down and demanded my roommate tell me\nwhy he hadn\u2019t pointed out the lilacs earlier, and he threw up\nhis hands: he had tried, but I had talked over him.\nWhen the kisser who recommended I take snapshots\nof my surroundings came to my apartment, there is a chance\nthat they noticed many more things: they probably know\nwhether it is broken up at any point by vinyl siding, or what words\nappear on the inflatable Santa down the hill. When we passed\nthrough the park, I did attempt to capture the snow lifting\nfrom the ground in spirals, the two bodies\u2014one seated, one running\u2014blocking\nsome light, the corner-eye view of their metallic jacket. But I wanted\nto remember what we looked like to the seated person, so replaced the above\ndescription with an imagined photo of two people connected\nby elbows, which I now see instead.\nMy panic, when it comes in public, starts\nwith lost vision; at home, with the heart. The classroom used to turn\nto white: I could make out, maybe, the light from the streetlamps\nvisible from the class\u2019 windows, but the shapes of the students\u2019 faces\nand the windows themselves would be gone. I got very good\nat remembering where I had left my chair, sitting down, and pretending\nto glance thoughtfully at my notebook. If I said \u201cyes, mmhmm,\nanyone else?\u201d my students would feel prompted to speak\nwithout raising hands, and sometimes I\u2019d take illegible\nnotes on their comments in order to prolong the period\nbefore I would need my eyesight back. If no voices emerged, but\nI could register the electronic sounds enough to know my hearing\nwas still with me, I would spontaneously become a person\nwho lectures, or I would ask them to break into groups of 3-4\nto collectively answer some question. Years before, when sound\nand sight left together, I would sit on the floor\nof the subway hoping to faint from a more auspicious\nstarting position. Looking at things indirectly\u2014on a telephone,\nsay\u2014does not typically produce such a reaction.\n",

Why\u2019s that?  She\u2019s hardly felt\nhated. X\u2019s and O\u2019s glow in the daughter\u2019s palm. Look\nhow easy\nbe the child at the center of snow & flu season.

  "text": "Giannina: I\u2019m burying the sardine\u2014the dead body I carry on my back.\nZarathustra: A little fish\u2014in a little coffin. And for this\u2014for this little stinky\nthing\u2014we came from so far?\nGiannina: Look, it\u2019s moving. It\u2019s still alive.\nZarathustra: It\u2019s so salty and ugly it itches and bites.\nGiannina: It worked its whole life in the sludge of oil and vinegar. I\u2019ll sprinkle\nincense, myrrh, and a pound of gold to be buried with it under the\nsand.\nHamlet: Hurry up. The ferry will leave without us.\nGiannina: You have no idea how much I\u2019ve suffered under the influence of\nthis rigorous but retarded sardine. Not a warrior, but a soldier. Making me\nvow to its regiment of passive-aggressive work. No traveling was allowed.\nNo smoking allowed. No pets allowed. No one could get near me\nbecause the sardine would stink\u2014and its stink would bite. Sometimes it\nwould fly around the rim, but it would always dive back into the can\nsardines\u2014looking for its paycheck. Every two weeks\u2014it brought me a\nsalary\u2014the stinky sardine\u2014and I brought home all I could buy with that\nsalary\u2014confinement, imprisonment. Depending on a salary made me\nsalivate\u2014but it blew my mind to dust\u2014the dust that blows around and\nmakes you cough\u2014but you hardly can see it because it\u2019s made of dust. But\nI\u2019m not made of dust\u2014I\u2019m made of flesh\u2014and making love to the little\nsardine drove me crazy. It was such a little fish it barely filled my mouth. I\ncould hardly eat it. I grew hungry\u2014hungry for a big fish. God help me\u2014no\nmore fish! Please no clams, no oysters! Please\u2014nothing shelled or scaled!\nNothing salted\u2014nothing finned or fanged! Because it had fangs\u2014the\nsardine had fangs\u2014and it bit me like a rabid squirrel. It must have known I\nwanted to bury it. Its fangs were long\u2014and its screams were shrill\u2014and it\nheld grudges\u2014and it had bones to pick. It blamed me for keeping it\ndown\u2014but all I wanted was its liberation from the can. I wanted it to\nbreathe clean air\u2014and to sing. Your mouth is already open\u2014now take a\ndeep breath, little fishy, and sing\u2014sing a song of love. You know my cords\nare made of vibrant colors. You know I too come from the sea\u2014but I don\u2019t\ncome with grudges in my fangs. I come with wings to fly from your stink. I\nhate sardines.\nZarathustra: Then why do you eat them?\nGiannina: Because I detest their helplessness. I wouldn\u2019t eat a lion. It would\neat me first. I eat what is weaker than me. I like lamb. I watch a grazing\nlamb, and my mouth waters. I could eat it alive. But not sardines. They\u2019re\nalready dead. They never lived. They\u2019re dead even when they\u2019re alive.\nAlways with their mouths open. Begging for water. And I don\u2019t mind\nbeggars. But sardines are not beggars\u2014they\u2019re squirmers. They beg for\nwater\u2014but what they really want is to eat you alive\u2014with their\ndeadliness\u2014which is a plague\u2014a virus\u2014bacteria\u2014something contagious\nthat kills you without killing you. They open their mouths to beg for\nwater\u2014but do nothing but gulp the draught and wait for water\u2014with their\nmouths\nopen\u2014as if snoring, which is worse than imploring\u2014they\u2019re beggarly\nbeggars that don\u2019t even beg\u2014they\u2019re too dead to beg\u2014and they\u2019re deadly\ncontagious. It\u2019s their deadliness that lingers over me every day of my\nlife\u2014the dead inertia of the sardine that obeys and begs for water, gallons\nof\nwater, and does what it\u2019s asked to do in spite of no water and denies itself\nso much\u2014that it doesn\u2019t realize it doesn\u2019t have a being anymore\u2014and it\nlets itself be canned\u2014always with its open mouth saying:\n\u2014Drop dead, but give me drops of water. I don\u2019t want to be buried\nalive. I want to survive. I\u2019m a salaried sardine. Give me more money.\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re so salty and ugly, they itch and bite. Because they\u2019re\nsalivating for salty salaries\u2014salty salaried sardines.\nZarathustra: It is not a sardine. It is a big fish.\nGiannina: The coffin is small, but the stench is immense.\n",

Discovery\nof water with sand. Neither poetry nor prose. Salt is for fish, salt is for\ndeath, the poem is not among the dead. Remember, but don\u2019t write it. Love\nher duendes and act as her Lazarus, but don\u2019t wake her. Sleepwalker\namong cats, thief among dogs, man among women, woman among men,\nblasphemous toward religion, fed up with poverty. Tear out poetry\u2019s voice.\nDon\u2019t let her find you, hide. Disregard her, ignore her, forsake her. Don\u2019t\ntouch her wounds, she\u2019ll scorn you. Back away. Scorn the poem. Develop\nwithout her. Give her the necessary distance. Let her feel conceited. Then\ninsult her for not having written with power. Deride her dreams, slap her\neyes. Kneel down and ask her forgiveness. Take the poem from her belly.\nSleep beside her, but don\u2019t avert your eyes. Listen to what she tells you in\ndreams. Acknowledge her when you see her spell the names of hell.\nDescend with her into hell, climb her streets, burn within her history. There\nare no names, no history. The volcano erupts and rushes toward the poem.\nI can\u2019t do anything but bash her against a rock. I can\u2019t do anything but\nembrace her. I can\u2019t do anything but insult her dreams, and she can\u2019t do\nanything but open the poem for me, just a crack, a crack in silence, without\nwatchmen or maidens, with a fowl and an owl to keep distant, to keep\nsilent, to show up barefoot. And she couldn\u2019t do anything but crash against\nthe rocks, and the wind couldn\u2019t do anything but blow her locks, and time\ncouldn\u2019t do anything but eternalize her moment. And poetry is nowhere in\nthe castle. She disappears through the trapdoor, escapes with the fire that\nburns her and dissolves in water.\n(Ars poetica in Spanish...)\nLa poes\u00eda es esta loca que grita. Todo parece poes\u00eda. Los locos miran alto.\nTodo parece locura. Los locos no le temen a la luna, ni le temen al fuego.\nLas quemaduras del cuerpo son poes\u00eda. Las heridas de los locos son\npoes\u00eda. El crimen de la bruja fue poes\u00eda. La magia supo encontrar su\npoes\u00eda. No era poes\u00eda la estrella antes de que la loca la descubriera.\nDescubrimiento del fuego en la estrella. Descubrimiento del agua con la\narena, no es poes\u00eda ni es prosa. La sal es de los peces, la sal es de la\nmuerte, no est\u00e1 el poema en la muerte. Recuerda, pero no lo escribas.\n\u00c1male los duendes, y s\u00edrvele de L\u00e1zaro, pero no la despiertes. Son\u00e1mbula\ncon los gatos, ladrona con los perros, hombre con las mujeres, mujer con\nlos hombres, blasfema con la religi\u00f3n, harta con la pobreza. Arr\u00e1ncale la\nvoz a la poes\u00eda. No dejes que te descubra, esc\u00f3ndete. No la pienses ni le\ndes importancia, aband\u00f3nala. No le toques las heridas, te despreciar\u00e1.\nAp\u00e1rtate. Despr\u00e9ciale el poema. Desenvu\u00e9lvete sin ella. Dale la ncesaria\ndistancia. Deja que se siente engre\u00edda. Entonces ins\u00faltala, por no haber\nescrito con fuerza. Entonces ultr\u00e1jale los sue\u00f1os, abofet\u00e9ale los ojos.\nArrod\u00edllate y p\u00eddele perd\u00f3n. S\u00e1cale el poema del vientre. Du\u00e9rmete a su\nlado, pero no la dejes de mirar. Escucha lo que en sue\u00f1os te dice.\nRecon\u00f3cela cuando la veas deletrear los nombres del infierno. Desciende\ncon ella al infierno, sube por sus calles, arde dentro de su historia. No hay\nnombres ni hay historia. Se precipita el volc\u00e1n y la lava est\u00e1 deseosa de\nintroducirse en el poema. No puedo menos que estrellarla contra una roca,\nno puedo menos que abrazarla. Ni puedo menos que insultarle los sue\u00f1os,\nni puede menos que entreabrirme el poema, a medio decir, en silencio, sin\ncentinelas ni doncellas, con una lechuza y un buho para guardar la\ndistancia, para guardar el silencio, para presentarsedescalza. Y ella no\npudo menos que estrellarse contra la roca, y el viento no pudo menos que\nsoplarle los cabellos, y el tiempo no pudo menos que eternizar su\nmomento. Y la poes\u00eda no est\u00e1 en todo el castillo, desaparece por la puerta\ndefuga, se va con el fuego que la quema y se disuelve en agua.\n",

An expression falls asleep and rises. And\nwhat was over there returns. It\u2019s a way to put the world back in its place.\nAnd something comes back when it should remain remembering. \nBut if I ring the bell, water jumps and a river falls out of the water again.\nAnd the body rises and shakes. And the rock wakes and says I sing. And a\nhand turns into a kerchief. And twilight and wind are companions. And this\ntwilight appears amid lightning. Outside there is a bird and a branch and a\ntree and that lightning. Above all, there is noon without form. And suddenly\neverything acquires movement. Two travelers meet and their shoes dance.\nAnd breeze and morning clash. And the seagull runs and the rabbit flies.\nAnd runs and runs, and the current ran. Behind what runs is life. Behind\nthat silence is the door.\n",

Lac,\nit is said. Or albumen.\n    Gourds, chikus, com-\nprehensions of ripeness.\nWhat\u2019s fresh, what\u2019s\n   not, under the same\nfeckless auspices.\nLuxury, it is said, moves,\n    sometimes, at midday.\nMellow the light cast on\nsuch euphemistic striations.\n        On the goathooks\n(up ahead), on the garlands\n    (up ahead up ahead).\nThe muffled scene of death\nto which the lines proceed,\ncurved. Citrus curling up\n   the light, so tart it is.\n   But here, here where it\ncommences, here, from where\nthe lines, endless, proceed,\n    here the voices, here\nthe prices. Lacquer on this\nproduce, surreal photography,\ntainted reverie. Nothing clean\nyet, presence implied, not seen.\n        It proceeds, an extreme\n   intelligence can be held\nin the hands, is. Slight burn\n    from the citrus, slight build\nfrom up the ground. Euphemism\n    for shanty. Euphemism for\n        indigence. Skinny body,\nslender bean, sturdy drumsticks\n   snap. Nothing clean, yet\nthe causal knives luxuriate.\nLone jackfruit, abandoned\nbeehive. Nightshade in terror\n    of being shook. The lymph is\nanxious. The child rears her\n        ugly head, slow capacity\nfor memory. Lacquer, she says.\n   Lacquer on this. This kind of\ntraffick is difficult to curb. Her skin\nis light, her mother\u2019s translucent.\n    This is how it begins, the acts\nof comprehending things, softening,\n   into the basket, plastic,\n        the voiceless hellos, a\n      tendency, hushed.\n   An impossible sculptural\n    aspect her eyes laminate.\nThings mature along\n   this aisle that\u2019s endless.\nAnd she too, in the town\ncalled Fraser, opposite\nthe police station and the\npork shop, parallel to the\nrailway track, she too\n        developed symptoms,\n    hysteria, depression,\n     a deviant sexualized\n    mesmerism. She told us,\nnot without resistance,\n      that she had had an\n   education. Her mother\nspoke the apt languages.\nShe said nothing but lacquer.\n   Lacquer on this. The brain\nlike a jelly, something trapped\n        in it. She views it\nwith her double-eye, its\n      glittering mound\n   of curvatures, lipid-rich\n      broth. We call it in the vulgar\ngelatin. We will return to this point\nlater. For the child rears her head\nto the sound of community, which\n   she hears as tribe, later mafia.\n    She appears to comprehend\nbut does not the sorrow\n   of haggling. Whether she might\ncome to say it, let\u2019s not insure.\n   But it is here it commences.\nThe thickenings of lymph,\nthe persistent shyness, the passions.\n        It is endless. As symbol, luxury,\nshe finds, and poverty are the same.\n   She listens prodigally. Correlatives\n    appear, disappear. She lacquers\nthem. But poverty, she finds, is,\n    in act, in thought, a word, to her,\n   not otherwise permitted, real.\nArticulacy then was of elbows\n    and knees. The spirit never quite\nlevels between her mother and\n   the woman on the blue tarp,\nbut they touch hands. The mother\ncommunes with nearly every one.\n    The child rears her ugly head,\nquizzical. Recrudescence\n   that\u2019s luscious, shutting down\ninstitutes. Speak, she says, speak,\nmy heart is gelatin. If anything luxe\n        is, it is this severe\nunthinkable audio. Palatial,\n   she says. In futures glorious\nand systematic the word ATELIER\n   will come to describe this\n     pure fragment, this collapse of lines.\nCurvatures, she thinks. Conniptions.\n   The dusty, colloidal elegance, she\nthinks, of air. She views it with her\n        double-eye, sculptural aspect.\nA powdery substance overlays things,\nsteady music. It is here she comes to\n        comprehend, tender,\nlater, smell it. We call it in the vulgar\nmoney. Speak, she speaks. The humors\nreside not in but a quarter of an inch\n   away from her, settling sometimes\nas sweat. She was extraordinarily\n    vulnerable, with not even a\nrotten core. What might coerce her\n   to nostalgia. Hot tea chilled jelly\ndissolves. No quality here. It is\n      nothing and the saw. The recrude-\nscence is luscious, shuts down law.\n   It began as tendency. Petty crime.\n      Delirium of touching. Passion of\nthe silk. Subjective correlatives.\n   Desire, dark wishes, ossifications,\n   and abbreviations of sound. The\nrefusal to dance, the turning away\n    inside the apostrophe. Meditative\nprocessional. It got heavy. She\n   lacquered it. She viewed it with her\n      vulgar eye. She lacquered it.\n         No delicacy obtained. She put it\n   away in its pure future, glittering\nmound. The opposite of hot tea\n    and a biscuit. Lacquer on it.\nEndless, mostly. Difficult to discern.\n   The conniptions. Cognitions. This kind\nof traffick is difficult to curb. But no,\n       it did not affect her. No one was\n             spirited away. This was not the meadow\n         in which she grew. No one haggled,\n    no one withdrew. It was as a lacquer\non her.\n",

If men\u2019s bosoms\nwere to open and their torn flesh\nfall to the earth, inside would be\nnothing but a scatter of small, crushed fruit!\n     Love happens in the street, standing in the dust\nof saloons and public squares: the flower\ndies the day it\u2019s born. The trembling\nvirgin who would rather death\nhave her than some unknown youth;\nthe joy of trepidation; that feeling of heart\nset free from chest; the ineffable\npleasure of deserving; the sweet alarm\nof walking quick and straight\nfrom your love\u2019s home and breaking\ninto tears like a happy child;\u2014\nand that gazing of our love at the fire,\nas roses slowly blush a deeper color,\u2014\nBah, it\u2019s all a sham! Who has the time\nto be noble? Though like a golden\nbowl or sumptuous painting\na genteel lady sits in the magnate\u2019s home!\n     But if you\u2019re thirsty, reach out your arm,\nand drain some passing cup!\nThe dirtied cup rolls to the dust, then,\nand the expert taster\u2014breast blotted\nwith invisible blood\u2014goes happily,\ncrowned with myrtle, on his way!\nBodies are nothing now but trash,\npits and tatters! And souls\nare not the tree\u2019s lush fruit\ndown whose tender skin runs\nsweet juice in time of ripeness,\u2014\nbut fruit of the marketplace, ripened\nby the hardened laborer\u2019s brutal blows!\n     It is an age of dry lips!\nOf undreaming nights! Of life\ncrushed unripe! What is it that we lack,\nwithout which there is no gladness? Like a startled\nhare in the wild thicket of our breast,\nfleeing, tremulous, from a gleeful hunter,\nthe spirit takes cover;\nand Desire, on Fever\u2019s arm,\nbeats the thicket, like the rich hunter.\n     The city appals me! Full\nof cups to be emptied, and empty cups!\nI fear\u2014ah me!\u2014that this wine\nmay be poison, and sink its teeth,\nvengeful imp, in my veins!\nI thirst\u2014but for a wine that none on earth\nknows how to drink! I have not yet\nendured enough to break through the wall\nthat keeps me, ah grief!, from my vineyard!\nTake, oh squalid tasters\nof humble human wines, these cups\nfrom which, with no fear or pity,\nyou swill the lily\u2019s juice!\nTake them! I am honorable, and I am afraid!\nAmor de Cuidad Grande\nAmor de Cuidad Grande\n     De gorja son y rapidez los tiempos.\nCorre cual luz la voz; en alta aguja,\nCual nave despe\u00f1ada en sirte horrenda,\nH\u00fandese el rayo, y en ligera barca\nEl hombre, como alado, el aire hiende.\n\u00a1As\u00ed el amor, sin pompa ni misterio\nMuere, apenas nacido, de saciado!\nJaula es la villa de palomas muertas\nY \u00e1vidos cazadores! Si los pechos\nSe rompen de los hombres, y las carnes\nRotas por tierra ruedan, \u00a1no han de verse\nDentro m\u00e1s que frutillas estrujadas!\n     De gorja son y rapidez los tiempos.\nCorre cual luz la voz; en alta aguja,\nCual nave despe\u00f1ada en sirte horrenda,\nH\u00fandese el rayo, y en ligera barca\nEl hombre, como alado, el aire hiende.\n\u00a1As\u00ed el amor, sin pompa ni misterio\nMuere, apenas nacido, de saciado!\nJaula es la villa de palomas muertas\nY \u00e1vidos cazadores!

  "text": "Families roll on toward summer, its feral freedom, ocean waves \nbeckon every sibling like schools of skipjack leaping together to  \ncatch the sun on their silver scales. Bundles of beach umbrellas  \nwaiting to be raised high & planted for their temporary kingdoms.  \nTrucks bobbing with oranges, station wagons bouncing with  \nbabies in the back. Lovers fight in the red gleam of a rover or  \nswerve in the sweat of a frolick behind the wheel. A highway  \nstretch of to & fro, bodies raucous & guzzling. So many dreams  \nleaking from gas tanks, the oil drip of wasted want. A congested  \nuproar of miles in waiting. So many exits missed.  What-could-\nhave-beens, just beyond the turnpike. Dead ends. Concrete &\nunmoving.  \nMy aunt, a tree cutting herself down & me with, turns to me from  \nthe front seat, says, some of us didn\u2019t get the looks in the family, right?\nYou know how it is. My silence hits the lane markers, all we hear is  \nbumpbumpbump. All I hear is my t\u00edas telling each other, you are  \nbeautiful, mija, but wear a hat so you don\u2019t get too dark. All I hear is a  \nworld saying brownbrownbrown a little too much & I am furiously  \nstuffing my mouth with plantain chips crunching centuries  \nbetween my teeth, my lungs a bouquet catching a windfall of  \nparticles unseen. So much ugly \nI tug on my seatbelt to breathe a little easier, flicking all the dead  \nends off me. A cement barrier, the road of my throat. No one says  \nanything, the words filling the car like murky green lake water after  \na tumble off the road. I imagine the doors stuck in the pressure of  \nthe plunge, my drowned body floating to the surface not pretty  \nenough to salvage & burn. I spread to the shoals, a seasoned meal  \nin undertow, delicious, at least, to the fish. I am the fish, feral &  \nflying.  \nBut I am flopped against the window, a pane dusty with estival  \njudgment. I roll it down, gills gasping for air, my face a drum of  \nhighway breath, the 65 mph hot wind on my cheek reminding me  \nI am a body on an irreplaceable planet. Don\u2019t take everything so  \nseriously, \nI hear. \nRoll the window up, dear, it really is too loud. \n",

How to eat\na pupusa: \u00bffork & knife? or\n\u00bfopen it up & treat it like a taco? but\nthen, we\u2019re betraying our nationalistic (read:\nanti-black, anti-indigenous) impulse\nto not mix with anyone else. \u00bf& what\u2019s\nwith jalape\u00f1os in the curtido,\ncipotes? \u00bfWith using spicy \u201csalsa\u201d\ninstead of salsa de tomate? There\u2019s too many\n\u201crestaurantes,\u201d one side of the menu: Mexican,\nthe other, platos t\u00edpicos. Typically\nI want to order the ensalada, but then\nthey bring me an actual salad.\nI say: c\u00f3man miercoles, they\nwant to charge me extra for harina de arroz. Extra\npor los nueagados. There\u2019s\nnowhere I\u2019d rather be most\nthan in Abuelita\u2019s kitchen, watching her\nthrow bay leaves, tomatoes, garlic, or\u00e9gano\ninto the blender, then chicharr\u00f3n,\nhelping her sell to everyone that knows\nshe made the best pupusas\nfrom 1985 to 2004. By then,\nSalvadore\u00f1os became \u201cHermanos Lejanos,\u201d\nwe traded Col\u00f3n for Washingt\u00f3n. By then,\nLos Hermanos Flores looked for new singers\nevery time they returned from Los Yunaited\nto San Salvador. Stay, no se vayan,\nes-tei, no sean dundos, was all\nthose Salvadore\u00f1os could say.\nWe didn\u2019t listen & came here\nonly to be called Mexican or Puerto Rican,\ndepending on the coast. We had to fight\nfor our better horchata, not\nthe lazy whiter one with only rice. & when\nwe didn\u2019t want to fight\nwe tried to blend, speak more \u201cMexican,\u201d\nmore ira, more popote, more\nno pos guao. \u00a1N\u00f3, majes!\n\u00a1No se me hagan dundos,\nponganse trucha vos!\nWhen anyone wants to call you: Mexican.\nYou can just say: N\u00f3,\nactually, and\u00e1te a la M\u2014\nracista cara de nacionalista.\n",

Across a field that smells of sage,\na few horses loiter. I want to think\nthat they forgive me, since they\u2019re noble creatures.\nThey stamp and snort, reminding me they know\nnothing of forgiveness. I used to dream\nthat someday I\u2019d escape to San Francisco,\nwhen I was still in high school and I knew.\nTall and muscled, the horses are like the jocks\non the football team who beat me once, as if pain\nteaches truth and they knew I had to learn.\nI used to dream I was as white as them,\nthat I could slam my locker closed and not\nthink of jail. Some nightmares come true,\nlike when my uncle got arrested for\ncocaine. My family never talked about it,\nwhich made me realize they could also feel shame.\nThat\u2019s when I started dreaming I could be\na doctor someday, that I could get away,\nprescribe myself a new life. Right now, as\nthe city comes into view, I think of those\nanimals and hope they got what they deserved.\nThe city stretches out its arms, its two bridges\nto Oakland, to Stockton, to San Rafael,\nto Vallejo; places I could have been from\nbut wasn\u2019t. It looks just as it did\nall those years ago. Yet I know it\u2019s changed\nbecause so many of us died, like Rico,\nwho took me up here for the first time.\nWe kicked a soccer ball around and smoked\na joint. I think we talked about our dreams,\nbut who can remember dreams. I look out\nand the sun like your hand on my face\nis warm, and for a moment I think this is\nglorious, this is what forgiveness feels like.\n",

Here, he pointed\nTo the directions of his imprisonment. How the wings\nHave too much dulled and to take wing must orchestrate\nThe shattering of mirrors: fragile, fine, acicular. The yellowing\nBrightness is in the proximity to the light, like how one recognizes beneath\nThe lightbulb the chick nesting within an egg, as to trace how thick\nIllusions go in the labyrinth of plurality. Now, no matter what,\nThey seem a bouquet of bougainvillea on the palms, dreaming to be set free.\nThis may be true of desire. One first keeps to heart\nThe simplest things one loved in childhood: the chase after\nA kite broken loose, not minding the prickling thorns,\nThe mimosa\u2019s curtsey to the sole. That is what freedom simply is.\nNot playing patintero with shadows. Not captive to the multiplicity\nOf false geometry. Almost brittle but original.\nBIRDS IN FLIGHT, 1965\nHindi marami, kundi iisa.

Dito, ganap niyang\nNaituturo ang mga direksyon ng kanyang pagkakakulong. Lubos\nAng pagkakapurol ng mga pakpak at ang pagaspas ay orkestradong\nPagkabasag ng mga salamin: manipis, pino, linyado. Nasa lapit ng ilaw\nAng tingkad ng paninilaw, katulad kung papaano kinikikilala sa ilalim\nNg bombilya ang nanahang sisiw sa itlog, upang mabakas ang kapal\nNg pamamalikmata sa laberinto ng pluralidad. Ngayon, kahit papaano,\nTila pumpon ito ng mga bunggambilya sa palad, nangangarap makaalpas.\nNa maaring totoo ito ukol sa pagnanasa. Unang isinilid sa dibdib\nAng mga simpleng bagay na minahal noong kabataan: ang paghabol\nSa napatid na guryon, ang hindi pag-alintana sa kalabit ng mga tinik,\nAng pagyukod ng makahiya sa talampakan. Ganoon lamang ang kalayaan.\nHindi nakikipagpatintero sa mga anino. Hindi nakapiit sa multiplisidad\nNg mga huwad na hubog. Halos babasagin ngunit orihinal.\n",

  "text": "The brutal abduction and murder of 14-year-old\nAfrican American Emmett Till \nin Mississippi on August 28, 1955, \ngalvanized the emerging Civil Rights Movement.\nMartin Luther King, Jr. called his murder \n\u201cone of the most brutal and inhumane crimes \nof the 20th century.\u201d  \u2013Biography\nBut what I don\u2019t know is your favorite color, or\nyour favorite bubble gum flavor. I don\u2019t know if\nyou liked winter days, if you ever left the imprint of\nyour body in the snow to make an angel. And I want\nto know the song that you couldn\u2019t stop listening to,\nsinging it in your head, over and over. What was the\nsong? I want to know the games you liked to play, if\nyou ever climbed a tree, swam in a lake, looked up\nat the night sky and made a wish. And I want to\nknow who you thought you might become. Your\nmother told us you were good at science, that you\nloved art. I wonder if you had lived, would your\nmasterpieces be in a gallery or maybe you would\nhave kept them to yourself\u2014hidden treasures in a\nnotebook, or maybe you would have been an art\nteacher. Or maybe you would have been a baseball\nplayer. I am told you were good at that, too. So\nmany talents, raw and pliable. There is a tale told of\nyou baking a cake for your mother and you were\nyoung and boy and not good at baking, but still, you\nloved your mother, so you tried. The cake did not\ntaste good at all, and that became a family joke. Had\nyou lived, you might have gotten better at baking.\nAnd maybe you would have become a renowned\npastry chef and every time you\u2019d be interviewed,\nyou\u2019d tell the story of the horrible cake and you\u2019d\nlook back at how far you\u2019d come, at how much\nyou\u2019d grown. Maybe. These are things I do not\nknow. But I do know you were not just a Chicago\nboy meeting Mississippi, not just a whistling boy, a\nkidnapped boy, a brutalized boy, a bloated boy with\na ring on his finger, not just a boy in an open casket,\nnot just a buried boy, a gone boy. You were a boy\nwith a favorite dessert, a favorite place to play, a\nfavorite joke to tell. You were a boy with a favorite\nsong\u2014a song that you couldn\u2019t stop listening to,\ncouldn\u2019t stop singing it in your head, over and over.\nWhat was the song? Had you kept living, maybe\nyou would sing us that song, teaching us the\noriginal version. By now the song would be\nremixed, new verses added, but still the same.\nAnd the record keeps spinning, scratched and stuck\non the chorus. So many verses etched in the vinyl.\nSo many unfinished songs.\nYour name, the refrain: Emmett Till. Medgar Evers,\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Henry Dumas, Fred\nHampton, Mulugeta Seraw, Amadou Diallo, Sean\nBell, Aiyana Jones, Oscar Grant, Trayvon Martin,\nJordan Davis, Renisha McBride, Michael Brown,\nEric Garner, Michelle Cusseaux, Akai Gurley,\nTanisha Anderson, Tamir Rice, Tanisha Fonville,\nEzell Ford, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Sandra\nBland, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Stephon\nClark, Botham Jean, Aura Rosser, Atatiana\nJefferson, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George\nFloyd, Rayshard Brooks\nand this is to say, since you were taken away from\nus, so much has changed and everything is the\nsame. But always, your name is spoken. Like a holy\nchant, a rally cry, a prayer. We cannot, will not\nforget you. You are the song stuck in our hearts.\nAnd the record keeps spinning, spinning.\n",

Far away, to the place they keep\nall the other mothers to sleep on rubber mats and drink from rubber hoses.\nDon\u2019t worry, says the border agent, we will take good care of your mommy.\nMy mother mouths, Tranquila. Her teeth, two rows of gold I could pawn\nfor something shiny, something shiny like the border agent\u2019s gun.\nFriends, Americans, countrymen lend me your ears, so I can hear\nmy mother through bulletproof glass, so I can hear her over the roar\nof American cars crossing this dead river by the wave of an agent\u2019s pale hand.\n",

Sometimes\nthe only thing I want is to say marry me\neven though we both think marriage is archaic and weird\nor at least for us. It\u2019s not marry me I want to say\nbut rather weld with me like a net we also sit in.\nOh FaceTime face and shadow neck and the almost synced\nsound of our shared watching. You have a list of things\nthat are going to be the death of you,\nand so do I, which we cover in our debriefings.\nAll of this is to say that distance makes my heart go farther\ninto the terrain of heartfelt and I love it: how ordinarily\nclassifiable it is like feeling literal figurative butterflies\nin your stomach. The good being fundamental.\nSurprising love can happen at any part of one\u2019s life\nlike the pixels deciding when to flicker into bursts.\n",

Only to file\nback out live & alive, stroll back across\nthe rays of the eight-point star, rose-tile\nlight of return, sink back into the race-\ntrack of the East End with everything\nwe have now become. Sweet Lyric,\nlyceum of dreams, where once we came\nto rise into who Mama, not dime-store\nmagazines, promised us we were.\n",

  "author": "Mart\u00edn Espada",
  "text": "I. The First Horse\nCholera swarmed unseen through the water, lurking in wells and fountains,\nsquirming in garbage and excrement, infinitesimal worms drilling the intestines,\ntill all the water and salt would pour from the body, till the body became a worm,\nshriveling and writhing, a slug in salt, till the skin burned blue as flame, the skin\nof the peasant and the skin of the slave gone blue, the skin in the slave barracks blue,\nthe skin of ten thousand slaves blue. The Blue Death, face hidden in a bandanna,\ndug graves with the gravediggers, who fell into holes they shoveled for the dead.\nThe doctors died too, seeing the signs in the mirror, the hand with the razor shaking.\nII. The Second Horse\nDoctor Betances stepped off the boat, back from Paris, the humidity of the plague\nglistening in his beard. He saw the stepmother who fed him sink into a mound\nof dirt, her body empty as the husk of a locust in drought.He toweled off his hands.\nIn the quarantine tents there was laudanum by the bitter spoonful, the lemonade\nand broth; in the dim of the kerosene lamps there was the compress cool against\nthe forehead, the elixir of the bark from the cinchona tree. For peasants and slaves\nmoaning to their gods, the doctor prescribed chilled champagne to soothe the belly.\nFor the commander of the Spanish garrison, there was silence bitter as the spoon.\nIII. The Third Horse\nAt every hacienda, at every plantation, as the bodies of slaves rolled one by one\ninto ditches all hipbones and ribs, drained of water and salt, stripped of names,\nDoctor Betances commanded the torch for the barracks where the bodies would\ntangle together, stacked up as if they never left the ship that sailed from Africa,\nkept awake by the ravenous worms of the plague feasting upon them. Watching\nthe blue flames blacken the wood, the doctor and the slaves saw another plague\nburning away, the plague of manacles scraping the skin from hands that cut\nthe cane, the plague of the collar with four spikes for the runaways brought back.\nIV. The Fourth Horse\nThe pestilence of the masters, stirred by spoons into the coffee of the world,\nspread first at the marketplace, at auction, the coins passing from hand to hand.\nSo Doctor Betances began, at church, with twenty-five pesos in pieces of eight,\npirate coins dropped into the hands of slaves to drop into the hands of masters,\nbuying their own infants at the baptismal font. The secret society of abolitionists\nshoved rowboats full of runaways off the docks in the bluest hour of the blue night,\noff to islands without masters. Even the doctor would strangle in the executioner\u2019s\ngarrote, spittle in his beard, if the soldiers on watch woke up from the opiate of empire.\nV. The Fifth Horse\nThe governor circled his name in the name of empire, so Doctor Betances\nsailed away to exile, the island drowning in his sight, but a vision stung\nhis eyes like salt in the wind: in the world after the plague, no more\nplague of manacles; after the pestilence, no more pestilence of masters;\nafter the cemeteries of cholera, no more collar of spikes or executioners.\nIn his eye burned the blue of the rebel flag and the rising of his island.\nThe legend calls him the doctor who exhausted five horses, sleepless\nas he chased invisible armies into the night. Listen for the horses.\n",

After all\nthe meatloafs and apple pies we\u2019ve baked\nin our kitchen, I still sit down to the memory\nof my mother\u2019s table, savoring the loss of her\nonion-smothered vaca frita and creamy flan.\nNo matter how tastefully my throw pillows\nperfectly match my chic rugs and the stylish\nart on my walls, it all falls apart sometimes,\njust as I do, until I remember to be the boy\nI was, always should be, playing alone with\nhis Legos in the family room, still enchanted\nby the joy of his sheer self and his creations:\nperfect or not, beautiful or not, immortal or\nas mortal as the plentiful life I\u2019ve made here,\nalthough I keep living with my father dying\nin our old house, his head cradled in my hand\nfor a sip of tea and a kiss on his forehead\u2014\nour last goodbye in the home that still lives\nwithin this home where I live on to die, too.\n",

I read somewhere \n     that Goya never titled this painting, \nor the other eleven still lifes, so it\u2019s just \n     as well because I like the Spanish title better.  \n\u201cDoradas\u201d is simple, doesn\u2019t point \n     out the obvious.

A groundhog\nslippery and waddle thieving my tomatoes still\ngreen in the morning\u2019s shade. I watched her\nmunch and stand on her haunches taking such\npleasure in the watery bites. Why am I not allowed\ndelight? A stranger writes to request my thoughts\non suffering. Barbed wire pulled out of the mouth,\nas if demanding that I kneel to the trap of coiled\nspikes used in warfare and fencing. Instead,\nI watch the groundhog closer and a sound escapes\nme, a small spasm of joy I did not imagine\nwhen I woke. She is a funny creature and earnest,\nand she is doing what she can to survive.\n",

In Royal Buenos Ayres\nNow far, far behind are left the fire, and terrific heat.\nToday in thy verdant exultation all my day dreams will come to life\nAnd I shall inhale thy fragrant breath and bathe me in thy sun.\nA very good morning to thee, my orchard, and now I salute thy freshness\nAs it bursts forth from thy branches, while thy peach trees are in bloom;\nFramed about with rose bushes thy Florida Street\nLooks on while Glory, the Mart and Sport pass along.\nA little bird, a poet, meditates verses in his craw;\nGossipy and petulant, a sparrow goes chattering;\nThe climbing plants are arguing about political affairs;\nThe roses and the lilies talk of art and also of love.\nDriving his chariot team of fairy dragon flies,\nThe mischief making Puck of rich dreams passes\nAnd here is the splendid sportswoman in her celestial car,\nThe Imperial Titania followed by Oberon,\nAt night when the half ring of gold shows itself\nBeneath the tranquil blue of Heaven, the loved one of Pierrot,\n(It is a pallid feast which reigns now in the orchard)\nPlays upon her lyre the air, forsooth, do-re-mi-fa-sol.\nThe curious violets into her balcony are peeping\nAnd one of them sighs, \u201cTis a pity that the nightingale is not here!\u201d\nThe sylphs accompany the dances of the breezes\nIn a vague hazy Walpurgis of perfume and fantasy.\nSoon is heard the echo of the loud cry of the pampas.\nIt burns like the setting of the Argentine sun\nAnd a spectral horseman like a shadow crosses,\nOver his shoulder is a poncho, upon his face is grief.\nWho are you solitary traveler of the night?\n\u201cI am Poetry\u201d who once upon a time reigned here\nI am the last gaucho herdsman. I am going away forever\nFrom our ancient country and carrying away its heart.\n",

  "title": "Denial is a Cliff We Are Driven Over",
  "author": "Joy Priest",
  "text": "I want to believe Don West\nwhen he writes: none of mine\never made their living by driving slaves.\nBut in my grandfather\u2019s mouth that utterance\nwould\u2019ve taken on another meaning:\nIn the memory my mother shares,\nhe is flitting across Louisville\nin his taxi, passing back-and-forth\nlike a cardinal, red-faced, proud-breasted,\ndelivering Black folks their dry cleaning\u2014\nhad to, she tells me, as part of his route\u2014\nbut once he started his second shift and turned\non the cab light, he wouldn\u2019t accept\nBlack fare. I recall him reciting\nthe early presidents\u2019\nracist pseudoscience\u2014American\nat its liver\u2014to rationalize his hatred\nof my father, his denial\nof my Blackness. That denial a peril\nI survived, a cliff he could have driven me over\nat any moment of my childhood. Maybe,\nI want to think, because they were poor men\nwho labored, farmed tobacco and dug for oil,\nmy grandfather\u2019s people resisted\nslavery, felt a kinship with my father\u2019s people.\nOr that because my grandfather\nwas one of eleven mouths to feed\non their homestead\u2014reduced to dirt\nacross the Great Depression\u2014\nhe had a white identity to be proud of, a legacy\nthat didn\u2019t join our names\nin a bill of sale, but in struggle.\nI search his surname and it travels\nback to Germany, appears\non the deed to the house he inherited,\nretired and died in, poor-white resentment\ninflaming his stomach and liver.\nBut when I search the name I share with my father,\nmy only inheritance                      disappears\ninto the 19th century, sixth generation:\nmy ancestor bred\nto produce 248 offspring\nfor his owner, from whence comes\nour family name. Mr. West, here\nwe are different. Here, is where\nmy grandfather found his love for me discordant\nas the voice of the dead whispering\nhistory. Here is where we are connected,\nnot by class, but blood & slavery.\n",

Who mothered your love of death? \nHere is a heart-shaped stone to rub when you feel fear rising; \ngive me anything, an empty can of Pabst, a plastic souvenir, a t-shirt from Daytona.  \nHere is a first edition: The Complete Poems of Lucille Clifton.  \nGive me an ancient grove and a conversation by a creek, charms  \nto salve my griefs, something that says you are human, \nand I will give you the laughter in my brain and the tranquil eyes of my uncles.  \nShow me your grin in the middle of winter. \nIn the eighties we did the wop; you, too, have your dances.  \nIt is like stealing light from a flash in the sky. I promise:  \nno one is blaming you. No one is trying to replace you. \nIt\u2019s just that you are carrying a tainted clock calling it European History, \nstanding in khakis, eyes frightened like a mess of beetles. \n",

  "text": "Book I\nDeep in the shady sadness of a vale\nFar sunken from the healthy breath of morn,\nFar from the fiery noon, and eve\u2019s one star,\nSat gray-hair\u2019d Saturn, quiet as a stone,\nStill as the silence round about his lair;\nForest on forest hung about his head\nLike cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,\nNot so much life as on a summer\u2019s day\nRobs not one light seed from the feather\u2019d grass,\nBut where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.\nA stream went voiceless by, still deadened more\nBy reason of his fallen divinity\nSpreading a shade: the Naiad \u2019mid her reeds\nPress\u2019d her cold finger closer to her lips.\n    Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went,\nNo further than to where his feet had stray\u2019d,\nAnd slept there since. Upon the sodden ground\nHis old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,\nUnsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed;\nWhile his bow\u2019d head seem\u2019d list\u2019ning to the Earth,\nHis ancient mother, for some comfort yet.\n    It seem\u2019d no force could wake him from his place;\nBut there came one, who with a kindred hand\nTouch\u2019d his wide shoulders, after bending low\nWith reverence, though to one who knew it not.\nShe was a Goddess of the infant world;\nBy her in stature the tall Amazon\nHad stood a pigmy\u2019s height: she would have ta\u2019en\nAchilles by the hair and bent his neck;\nOr with a finger stay\u2019d Ixion\u2019s wheel.\nHer face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,\nPedestal\u2019d haply in a palace court,\nWhen sages look\u2019d to Egypt for their lore.\nBut oh! how unlike marble was that face:\nHow beautiful, if sorrow had not made\nSorrow more beautiful than Beauty\u2019s self.\nThere was a listening fear in her regard,\nAs if calamity had but begun;\nAs if the vanward clouds of evil days\nHad spent their malice, and the sullen rear\nWas with its stored thunder labouring up.\nOne hand she press\u2019d upon that aching spot\nWhere beats the human heart, as if just there,\nThough an immortal, she felt cruel pain:\nThe other upon Saturn\u2019s bended neck\nShe laid, and to the level of his ear\nLeaning with parted lips, some words she spake\nIn solemn tenour and deep organ tone:\nSome mourning words, which in our feeble tongue\nWould come in these like accents; O how frail\nTo that large utterance of the early Gods!\n\u201cSaturn, look up!\u2014though wherefore, poor old King?\nI have no comfort for thee, no not one:\nI cannot say, \u2019O wherefore sleepest thou?\u2019\nFor heaven is parted from thee, and the earth\nKnows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God;\nAnd ocean too, with all its solemn noise,\nHas from thy sceptre pass\u2019d; and all the air\nIs emptied of thine hoary majesty.\nThy thunder, conscious of the new command,\nRumbles reluctant o\u2019er our fallen house;\nAnd thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands\nScorches and burns our once serene domain.\nO aching time! O moments big as years!\nAll as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,\nAnd press it so upon our weary griefs\nThat unbelief has not a space to breathe.\nSaturn, sleep on:\u2014O thoughtless, why did I\nThus violate thy slumbrous solitude?\nWhy should I ope thy melancholy eyes?\nSaturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep.\u201d\n    As when, upon a tranced summer-night,\nThose green-rob\u2019d senators of mighty woods,\nTall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,\nDream, and so dream all night without a stir,\nSave from one gradual solitary gust\nWhich comes upon the silence, and dies off,\nAs if the ebbing air had but one wave;\nSo came these words and went; the while in tears\nShe touch\u2019d her fair large forehead to the ground,\nJust where her falling hair might be outspread\nA soft and silken mat for Saturn\u2019s feet.\nOne moon, with alteration slow, had shed\nHer silver seasons four upon the night,\nAnd still these two were postured motionless,\nLike natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;\nThe frozen God still couchant on the earth,\nAnd the sad Goddess weeping at his feet:\nUntil at length old Saturn lifted up\nHis faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,\nAnd all the gloom and sorrow of the place,\nAnd that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake,\nAs with a palsied tongue, and while his beard\nShook horrid with such aspen-malady:\n\u201cO tender spouse of gold Hyperion,\nThea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;\nLook up, and let me see our doom in it;\nLook up, and tell me if this feeble shape\nIs Saturn\u2019s; tell me, if thou hear\u2019st the voice\nOf Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,\nNaked and bare of its great diadem,\nPeers like the front of Saturn. Who had power\nTo make me desolate? whence came the strength?\nHow was it nurtur\u2019d to such bursting forth,\nWhile Fate seem\u2019d strangled in my nervous grasp?\nBut it is so; and I am smother\u2019d up,\nAnd buried from all godlike exercise\nOf influence benign on planets pale,\nOf admonitions to the winds and seas,\nOf peaceful sway above man\u2019s harvesting,\nAnd all those acts which Deity supreme\nDoth ease its heart of love in.\u2014I am gone\nAway from my own bosom: I have left\nMy strong identity, my real self,\nSomewhere between the throne, and where I sit\nHere on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search!\nOpen thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round\nUpon all space: space starr\u2019d, and lorn of light;\nSpace region\u2019d with life-air; and barren void;\nSpaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.\u2014\nSearch, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest\nA certain shape or shadow, making way\nWith wings or chariot fierce to repossess\nA heaven he lost erewhile: it must\u2014it must\nBe of ripe progress\u2014Saturn must be King.\nYes, there must be a golden victory;\nThere must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown\nOf triumph calm, and hymns of festival\nUpon the gold clouds metropolitan,\nVoices of soft proclaim, and silver stir\nOf strings in hollow shells; and there shall be\nBeautiful things made new, for the surprise\nOf the sky-children; I will give command:\nThea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?\u201d\n    This passion lifted him upon his feet,\nAnd made his hands to struggle in the air,\nHis Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,\nHis eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.\nHe stood, and heard not Thea\u2019s sobbing deep;\nA little time, and then again he snatch\u2019d\nUtterance thus.\u2014\u201cBut cannot I create?\nCannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth\nAnother world, another universe,\nTo overbear and crumble this to nought?\nWhere is another chaos? Where?\u201d\u2014That word\nFound way unto Olympus, and made quake\nThe rebel three.\u2014Thea was startled up,\nAnd in her bearing was a sort of hope,\nAs thus she quick-voic\u2019d spake, yet full of awe.\n    \u201cThis cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,\nO Saturn! come away, and give them heart;\nI know the covert, for thence came I hither.\u201d\nThus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went\nWith backward footing through the shade a space:\nHe follow\u2019d, and she turn\u2019d to lead the way\nThrough aged boughs, that yielded like the mist\nWhich eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.\nMeanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,\nMore sorrow like to this, and such like woe,\nToo huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:\nThe Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,\nGroan\u2019d for the old allegiance once more,\nAnd listen\u2019d in sharp pain for Saturn\u2019s voice.\nBut one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept\nHis sov\u2019reignty, and rule, and majesty;\u2014\nBlazing Hyperion on his orbed fire\nStill sat, still snuff\u2019d the incense, teeming up\nFrom man to the sun\u2019s God; yet unsecure:\nFor as among us mortals omens drear\nFright and perplex, so also shuddered he\u2014\nNot at dog\u2019s howl, or gloom-bird\u2019s hated screech,\nOr the familiar visiting of one\nUpon the first toll of his passing-bell,\nOr prophesyings of the midnight lamp;\nBut horrors, portion\u2019d to a giant nerve,\nOft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright\nBastion\u2019d with pyramids of glowing gold,\nAnd touch\u2019d with shade of bronzed obelisks,\nGlar\u2019d a blood-red through all its thousand courts,\nArches, and domes, and fiery galleries;\nAnd all its curtains of Aurorian clouds\nFlush\u2019d angerly: while sometimes eagle\u2019s wings,\nUnseen before by Gods or wondering men,\nDarken\u2019d the place; and neighing steeds were heard,\nNot heard before by Gods or wondering men.\nAlso, when he would taste the spicy wreaths\nOf incense, breath\u2019d aloft from sacred hills,\nInstead of sweets, his ample palate took\nSavour of poisonous brass and metal sick:\nAnd so, when harbour\u2019d in the sleepy west,\nAfter the full completion of fair day,\u2014\nFor rest divine upon exalted couch\nAnd slumber in the arms of melody,\nHe pac\u2019d away the pleasant hours of ease\nWith stride colossal, on from hall to hall;\nWhile far within each aisle and deep recess,\nHis winged minions in close clusters stood,\nAmaz\u2019d and full of fear; like anxious men\nWho on wide plains gather in panting troops,\nWhen earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.\nEven now, while Saturn, rous\u2019d from icy trance,\nWent step for step with Thea through the woods,\nHyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,\nCame slope upon the threshold of the west;\nThen, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope\nIn smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,\nBlown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet\nAnd wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;\nAnd like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,\nIn fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,\nThat inlet to severe magnificence\nStood full blown, for the God to enter in.\n    He enter\u2019d, but he enter\u2019d full of wrath;\nHis flaming robes stream\u2019d out beyond his heels,\nAnd gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,\nThat scar\u2019d away the meek ethereal Hours\nAnd made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared,\nFrom stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,\nThrough bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,\nAnd diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,\nUntil he reach\u2019d the great main cupola;\nThere standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,\nAnd from the basements deep to the high towers\nJarr\u2019d his own golden region; and before\nThe quavering thunder thereupon had ceas\u2019d,\nHis voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,\nTo this result: \u201cO dreams of day and night!\nO monstrous forms! O effigies of pain!\nO spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!\nO lank-eared Phantoms of black-weeded pools!\nWhy do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why\nIs my eternal essence thus distraught\nTo see and to behold these horrors new?\nSaturn is fallen, am I too to fall?\nAm I to leave this haven of my rest,\nThis cradle of my glory, this soft clime,\nThis calm luxuriance of blissful light,\nThese crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,\nOf all my lucent empire? It is left\nDeserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.\nThe blaze, the splendor, and the symmetry,\nI cannot see\u2014but darkness, death and darkness.\nEven here, into my centre of repose,\nThe shady visions come to domineer,\nInsult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.\u2014\nFall!\u2014No, by Tellus and her briny robes!\nOver the fiery frontier of my realms\nI will advance a terrible right arm\nShall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove,\nAnd bid old Saturn take his throne again.\u201d\u2014\nHe spake, and ceas\u2019d, the while a heavier threat\nHeld struggle with his throat but came not forth;\nFor as in theatres of crowded men\nHubbub increases more they call out \u201cHush!\u201d\nSo at Hyperion\u2019s words the Phantoms pale\nBestirr\u2019d themselves, thrice horrible and cold;\nAnd from the mirror\u2019d level where he stood\nA mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.\nAt this, through all his bulk an agony\nCrept gradual, from the feet unto the crown,\nLike a lithe serpent vast and muscular\nMaking slow way, with head and neck convuls\u2019d\nFrom over-strained might. Releas\u2019d, he fled\nTo the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours\nBefore the dawn in season due should blush,\nHe breath\u2019d fierce breath against the sleepy portals,\nClear\u2019d them of heavy vapours, burst them wide\nSuddenly on the ocean\u2019s chilly streams.\nThe planet orb of fire, whereon he rode\nEach day from east to west the heavens through,\nSpun round in sable curtaining of clouds;\nNot therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid,\nBut ever and anon the glancing spheres,\nCircles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure,\nGlow\u2019d through, and wrought upon the muffling dark\nSweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep\nUp to the zenith,\u2014hieroglyphics old,\nWhich sages and keen-eyed astrologers\nThen living on the earth, with labouring thought\nWon from the gaze of many centuries:\nNow lost, save what we find on remnants huge\nOf stone, or marble swart; their import gone,\nTheir wisdom long since fled.\u2014Two wings this orb\nPossess\u2019d for glory, two fair argent wings,\nEver exalted at the God\u2019s approach:\nAnd now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense\nRose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;\nWhile still the dazzling globe maintain\u2019d eclipse,\nAwaiting for Hyperion\u2019s command.\nFain would he have commanded, fain took throne\nAnd bid the day begin, if but for change.\nHe might not:\u2014No, though a primeval God:\nThe sacred seasons might not be disturb\u2019d.\nTherefore the operations of the dawn\nStay\u2019d in their birth, even as here \u2019tis told.\nThose silver wings expanded sisterly,\nEager to sail their orb; the porches wide\nOpen\u2019d upon the dusk demesnes of night\nAnd the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,\nUnus\u2019d to bend, by hard compulsion bent\nHis spirit to the sorrow of the time;\nAnd all along a dismal rack of clouds,\nUpon the boundaries of day and night,\nHe stretch\u2019d himself in grief and radiance faint.\nThere as he lay, the Heaven with its stars\nLook\u2019d down on him with pity, and the voice\nOf C\u0153lus, from the universal space,\nThus whisper\u2019d low and solemn in his ear.\n\u201cO brightest of my children dear, earth-born\nAnd sky-engendered, Son of Mysteries\nAll unrevealed even to the powers\nWhich met at thy creating; at whose joys\nAnd palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft,\nI, C\u0153lus, wonder, how they came and whence;\nAnd at the fruits thereof what shapes they be,\nDistinct, and visible; symbols divine,\nManifestations of that beauteous life\nDiffus\u2019d unseen throughout eternal space:\nOf these new-form\u2019d art thou, oh brightest child!\nOf these, thy brethren and the Goddesses!\nThere is sad feud among ye, and rebellion\nOf son against his sire. I saw him fall,\nI saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!\nTo me his arms were spread, to me his voice\nFound way from forth the thunders round his head!\nPale wox I, and in vapours hid my face.\nArt thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:\nFor I have seen my sons most unlike Gods.\nDivine ye were created, and divine\nIn sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb\u2019d,\nUnruffled, like high Gods, ye liv\u2019d and ruled:\nNow I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;\nActions of rage and passion; even as\nI see them, on the mortal world beneath,\nIn men who die.\u2014This is the grief, O Son!\nSad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!\nYet do thou strive; as thou art capable,\nAs thou canst move about, an evident God;\nAnd canst oppose to each malignant hour\nEthereal presence:\u2014I am but a voice;\nMy life is but the life of winds and tides,\nNo more than winds and tides can I avail:\u2014\nBut thou canst.\u2014Be thou therefore in the van\nOf circumstance; yea, seize the arrow\u2019s barb\nBefore the tense string murmur.\u2014To the earth!\nFor there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes.\nMeantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun,\nAnd of thy seasons be a careful nurse.\u201d\u2014\nEre half this region-whisper had come down,\nHyperion arose, and on the stars\nLifted his curved lids, and kept them wide\nUntil it ceas\u2019d; and still he kept them wide:\nAnd still they were the same bright, patient stars.\nThen with a slow incline of his broad breast,\nLike to a diver in the pearly seas,\nForward he stoop\u2019d over the airy shore,\nAnd plung\u2019d all noiseless into the deep night.\nBook II\nJust at the self-same beat of Time\u2019s wide wings\nHyperion slid into the rustled air,\nAnd Saturn gain\u2019d with Thea that sad place\nWhere Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn\u2019d.\nIt was a den where no insulting light\nCould glimmer on their tears; where their own groans\nThey felt, but heard not, for the solid roar\nOf thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,\nPouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.\nCrag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem\u2019d\nEver as if just rising from a sleep,\nForehead to forehead held their monstrous horns;\nAnd thus in thousand hugest phantasies\nMade a fit roofing to this nest of woe.\nInstead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,\nCouches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge\nStubborn\u2019d with iron. All were not assembled:\nSome chain\u2019d in torture, and some wandering.\nC\u0153us, and Gyges, and Briare\u00fcs,\nTyphon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,\nWith many more, the brawniest in assault,\nWere pent in regions of laborious breath;\nDungeon\u2019d in opaque element, to keep\nTheir clenched teeth still clench\u2019d, and all their limbs\nLock\u2019d up like veins of metal, crampt and screw\u2019d;\nWithout a motion, save of their big hearts\nHeaving in pain, and horribly convuls\u2019d\nWith sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.\nMnemosyne was straying in the world;\nFar from her moon had Ph\u0153be wandered;\nAnd many else were free to roam abroad,\nBut for the main, here found they covert drear.\nScarce images of life, one here, one there,\nLay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque\nOf Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,\nWhen the chill rain begins at shut of eve,\nIn dull November, and their chancel vault,\nThe Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.\nEach one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave\nOr word, or look, or action of despair.\nCre\u00fcs was one; his ponderous iron mace\nLay by him, and a shatter\u2019d rib of rock\nTold of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.\nI\u00e4petus another; in his grasp,\nA serpent\u2019s plashy neck; its barbed tongue\nSqueez\u2019d from the gorge, and all its uncurl\u2019d length\nDead; and because the creature could not spit\nIts poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.\nNext Cottus: prone he lay, chin uppermost,\nAs though in pain; for still upon the flint\nHe ground severe his skull, with open mouth\nAnd eyes at horrid working. Nearest him\nAsia, born of most enormous Caf,\nWho cost her mother Tellus keener pangs,\nThough feminine, than any of her sons:\nMore thought than woe was in her dusky face,\nFor she was prophesying of her glory;\nAnd in her wide imagination stood\nPalm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes,\nBy Oxus or in Ganges\u2019 sacred isles.\nEven as Hope upon her anchor leans,\nSo leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk\nShed from the broadest of her elephants.\nAbove her, on a crag\u2019s uneasy shelve,\nUpon his elbow rais\u2019d, all prostrate else,\nShadow\u2019d Enceladus; once tame and mild\nAs grazing ox unworried in the meads;\nNow tiger-passion\u2019d, lion-thoughted, wroth,\nHe meditated, plotted, and even now\nWas hurling mountains in that second war,\nNot long delay\u2019d, that scar\u2019d the younger Gods\nTo hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.\nNot far hence Atlas; and beside him prone\nPhorcus, the sire of Gorgons. Neighbour\u2019d close\nOceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap\nSobb\u2019d Clymene among her tangled hair.\nIn midst of all lay Themis, at the feet\nOf Ops the queen all clouded round from sight;\nNo shape distinguishable, more than when\nThick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds:\nAnd many else whose names may not be told.\nFor when the Muse\u2019s wings are air-ward spread,\nWho shall delay her flight? And she must chaunt\nOf Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb\u2019d\nWith damp and slippery footing from a depth\nMore horrid still. Above a sombre cliff\nTheir heads appear\u2019d, and up their stature grew\nTill on the level height their steps found ease:\nThen Thea spread abroad her trembling arms\nUpon the precincts of this nest of pain,\nAnd sidelong fix\u2019d her eye on Saturn\u2019s face:\nThere saw she direst strife; the supreme God\nAt war with all the frailty of grief,\nOf rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge,\nRemorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair.\nAgainst these plagues he strove in vain; for Fate\nHad pour\u2019d a mortal oil upon his head,\nA disanointing poison: so that Thea,\nAffrighted, kept her still, and let him pass\nFirst onwards in, among the fallen tribe.\n    As with us mortal men, the laden heart\nIs persecuted more, and fever\u2019d more,\nWhen it is nighing to the mournful house\nWhere other hearts are sick of the same bruise;\nSo Saturn, as he walk\u2019d into the midst,\nFelt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,\nBut that he met Enceladus\u2019s eye,\nWhose mightiness, and awe of him, at once\nCame like an inspiration; and he shouted,\n\u201cTitans, behold your God!\u201d at which some groan\u2019d;\nSome started on their feet; some also shouted;\nSome wept, some wail\u2019d, all bow\u2019d with reverence;\nAnd Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,\nShow\u2019d her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,\nHer eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.\nThere is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines\nWhen Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise\nAmong immortals when a God gives sign,\nWith hushing finger, how he means to load\nHis tongue with the full weight of utterless thought,\nWith thunder, and with music, and with pomp:\nSuch noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines;\nWhich, when it ceases in this mountain\u2019d world,\nNo other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,\nAmong these fallen, Saturn\u2019s voice therefrom\nGrew up like organ, that begins anew\nIts strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,\nLeave the dinn\u2019d air vibrating silverly.\nThus grew it up\u2014\u201cNot in my own sad breast,\nWhich is its own great judge and searcher out,\nCan I find reason why ye should be thus:\nNot in the legends of the first of days,\nStudied from that old spirit-leaved book\nWhich starry Uranus with finger bright\nSav\u2019d from the shores of darkness, when the waves\nLow-ebb\u2019d still hid it up in shallow gloom;\u2014\nAnd the which book ye know I ever kept\nFor my firm-based footstool:\u2014Ah, infirm!\nNot there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent\nOf element, earth, water, air, and fire,\u2014\nAt war, at peace, or inter-quarreling\nOne against one, or two, or three, or all\nEach several one against the other three,\nAs fire with air loud warring when rain-floods\nDrown both, and press them both against earth\u2019s face,\nWhere, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath\nUnhinges the poor world;\u2014not in that strife,\nWherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep,\nCan I find reason why ye should be thus:\nNo, no-where can unriddle, though I search,\nAnd pore on Nature\u2019s universal scroll\nEven to swooning, why ye, Divinities,\nThe first-born of all shap\u2019d and palpable Gods,\nShould cower beneath what, in comparison,\nIs untremendous might. Yet ye are here,\nO\u2019erwhelm\u2019d, and spurn\u2019d, and batter\u2019d, ye are here!\nO Titans, shall I say \u2019Arise!\u2019\u2014Ye groan:\nShall I say \u2019Crouch!\u2019\u2014Ye groan. What can I then?\nO Heaven wide! O unseen parent dear!\nWhat can I? Tell me, all ye brethren Gods,\nHow we can war, how engine our great wrath!\nO speak your counsel now, for Saturn\u2019s ear\nIs all a-hunger\u2019d. Thou, Oceanus,\nPonderest high and deep; and in thy face\nI see, astonied, that severe content\nWhich comes of thought and musing: give us help!\u201d\n    So ended Saturn; and the God of the Sea,\nSophist and sage, from no Athenian grove,\nBut cogitation in his watery shades,\nArose, with locks not oozy, and began,\nIn murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue\nCaught infant-like from the far-foamed sands.\n\u201cO ye, whom wrath consumes! who, passion-stung,\nWrithe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!\nShut up your senses, stifle up your ears,\nMy voice is not a bellows unto ire.\nYet listen, ye who will, whilst I bring proof\nHow ye, perforce, must be content to stoop:\nAnd in the proof much comfort will I give,\nIf ye will take that comfort in its truth.\nWe fall by course of Nature\u2019s law, not force\nOf thunder, or of Jove. Great Saturn, thou\nHast sifted well the atom-universe;\nBut for this reason, that thou art the King,\nAnd only blind from sheer supremacy,\nOne avenue was shaded from thine eyes,\nThrough which I wandered to eternal truth.\nAnd first, as thou wast not the first of powers,\nSo art thou not the last; it cannot be:\nThou art not the beginning nor the end.\nFrom chaos and parental darkness came\nLight, the first fruits of that intestine broil,\nThat sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends\nWas ripening in itself. The ripe hour came,\nAnd with it light, and light, engendering\nUpon its own producer, forthwith touch\u2019d\nThe whole enormous matter into life.\nUpon that very hour, our parentage,\nThe Heavens and the Earth, were manifest:\nThen thou first-born, and we the giant-race,\nFound ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.\nNow comes the pain of truth, to whom \u2019tis pain;\nO folly! for to bear all naked truths,\nAnd to envisage circumstance, all calm,\nThat is the top of sovereignty. Mark well!\nAs Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far\nThan Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;\nAnd as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth\nIn form and shape compact and beautiful,\nIn will, in action free, companionship,\nAnd thousand other signs of purer life;\nSo on our heels a fresh perfection treads,\nA power more strong in beauty, born of us\nAnd fated to excel us, as we pass\nIn glory that old Darkness: nor are we\nThereby more conquer\u2019d, than by us the rule\nOf shapeless Chaos. Say, doth the dull soil\nQuarrel with the proud forests it hath fed,\nAnd feedeth still, more comely than itself?\nCan it deny the chiefdom of green groves?\nOr shall the tree be envious of the dove\nBecause it cooeth, and hath snowy wings\nTo wander wherewithal and find its joys?\nWe are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs\nHave bred forth, not pale solitary doves,\nBut eagles golden-feather\u2019d, who do tower\nAbove us in their beauty, and must reign\nIn right thereof; for \u2019tis the eternal law\nThat first in beauty should be first in might:\nYea, by that law, another race may drive\nOur conquerors to mourn as we do now.\nHave ye beheld the young God of the Seas,\nMy dispossessor? Have ye seen his face?\nHave ye beheld his chariot, foam\u2019d along\nBy noble winged creatures he hath made?\nI saw him on the calmed waters scud,\nWith such a glow of beauty in his eyes,\nThat it enforc\u2019d me to bid sad farewell\nTo all my empire: farewell sad I took,\nAnd hither came, to see how dolorous fate\nHad wrought upon ye; and how I might best\nGive consolation in this woe extreme.\nReceive the truth, and let it be your balm.\u201d\n    Whether through poz\u2019d conviction, or disdain,\nThey guarded silence, when Oceanus\nLeft murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?\nBut so it was, none answer\u2019d for a space,\nSave one whom none regarded, Clymene;\nAnd yet she answer\u2019d not, only complain\u2019d,\nWith hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,\nThus wording timidly among the fierce:\n\u201cO Father, I am here the simplest voice,\nAnd all my knowledge is that joy is gone,\nAnd this thing woe crept in among our hearts,\nThere to remain for ever, as I fear:\nI would not bode of evil, if I thought\nSo weak a creature could turn off the help\nWhich by just right should come of mighty Gods;\nYet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell\nOf what I heard, and how it made me weep,\nAnd know that we had parted from all hope.\nI stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,\nWhere a sweet clime was breathed from a land\nOf fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.\nFull of calm joy it was, as I of grief;\nToo full of joy and soft delicious warmth;\nSo that I felt a movement in my heart\nTo chide, and to reproach that solitude\nWith songs of misery, music of our woes;\nAnd sat me down, and took a mouthed shell\nAnd murmur\u2019d into it, and made melody\u2014\nO melody no more! for while I sang,\nAnd with poor skill let pass into the breeze\nThe dull shell\u2019s echo, from a bowery strand\nJust opposite, an island of the sea,\nThere came enchantment with the shifting wind,\nThat did both drown and keep alive my ears.\nI threw my shell away upon the sand,\nAnd a wave fill\u2019d it, as my sense was fill\u2019d\nWith that new blissful golden melody.\nA living death was in each gush of sounds,\nEach family of rapturous hurried notes,\nThat fell, one after one, yet all at once,\nLike pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:\nAnd then another, then another strain,\nEach like a dove leaving its olive perch,\nWith music wing\u2019d instead of silent plumes,\nTo hover round my head, and make me sick\nOf joy and grief at once. Grief overcame,\nAnd I was stopping up my frantic ears,\nWhen, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,\nA voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,\nAnd still it cried, \u2019Apollo! young Apollo!\nThe morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!\u2019\nI fled, it follow\u2019d me, and cried \u2019Apollo!\u2019\nO Father, and O Brethren, had ye felt\nThose pains of mine; O Saturn, hadst thou felt,\nYe would not call this too indulged tongue\nPresumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard.\u201d\n    So far her voice flow\u2019d on, like timorous brook\nThat, lingering along a pebbled coast,\nDoth fear to meet the sea: but sea it met,\nAnd shudder\u2019d; for the overwhelming voice\nOf huge Enceladus swallow\u2019d it in wrath:\nThe ponderous syllables, like sullen waves\nIn the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks,\nCame booming thus, while still upon his arm\nHe lean\u2019d; not rising, from supreme contempt.\n\u201cOr shall we listen to the over-wise,\nOr to the over-foolish, Giant-Gods?\nNot thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all\nThat rebel Jove\u2019s whole armoury were spent,\nNot world on world upon these shoulders piled,\nCould agonize me more than baby-words\nIn midst of this dethronement horrible.\nSpeak! roar! shout! yell! ye sleepy Titans all.\nDo ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?\nAre ye not smitten by a youngling arm?\nDost thou forget, sham Monarch of the Waves,\nThy scalding in the seas? What, have I rous\u2019d\nYour spleens with so few simple words as these?\nO joy! for now I see ye are not lost:\nO joy! for now I see a thousand eyes\nWide glaring for revenge!\u201d\u2014As this he said,\nHe lifted up his stature vast, and stood,\nStill without intermission speaking thus:\n\u201cNow ye are flames, I\u2019ll tell you how to burn,\nAnd purge the ether of our enemies;\nHow to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire,\nAnd singe away the swollen clouds of Jove,\nStifling that puny essence in its tent.\nO let him feel the evil he hath done;\nFor though I scorn Oceanus\u2019s lore,\nMuch pain have I for more than loss of realms:\nThe days of peace and slumberous calm are fled;\nThose days, all innocent of scathing war,\nWhen all the fair Existences of heaven\nCame open-eyed to guess what we would speak:\u2014\nThat was before our brows were taught to frown,\nBefore our lips knew else but solemn sounds;\nThat was before we knew the winged thing,\nVictory, might be lost, or might be won.\nAnd be ye mindful that Hyperion,\nOur brightest brother, still is undisgraced\u2014\nHyperion, lo! his radiance is here!\u201d\n    All eyes were on Enceladus\u2019s face,\nAnd they beheld, while still Hyperion\u2019s name\nFlew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks,\nA pallid gleam across his features stern:\nNot savage, for he saw full many a God\nWroth as himself. He look\u2019d upon them all,\nAnd in each face he saw a gleam of light,\nBut splendider in Saturn\u2019s, whose hoar locks\nShone like the bubbling foam about a keel\nWhen the prow sweeps into a midnight cove.\nIn pale and silver silence they remain\u2019d,\nTill suddenly a splendour, like the morn,\nPervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps,\nAll the sad spaces of oblivion,\nAnd every gulf, and every chasm old,\nAnd every height, and every sullen depth,\nVoiceless, or hoarse with loud tormented streams:\nAnd all the everlasting cataracts,\nAnd all the headlong torrents far and near,\nMantled before in darkness and huge shade,\nNow saw the light and made it terrible.\nIt was Hyperion:\u2014a granite peak\nHis bright feet touch\u2019d, and there he stay\u2019d to view\nThe misery his brilliance had betray\u2019d\nTo the most hateful seeing of itself.\nGolden his hair of short Numidian curl,\nRegal his shape majestic, a vast shade\nIn midst of his own brightness, like the bulk\nOf Memnon\u2019s image at the set of sun\nTo one who travels from the dusking East:\nSighs, too, as mournful as that Memnon\u2019s harp\nHe utter\u2019d, while his hands contemplative\nHe press\u2019d together, and in silence stood.\nDespondence seiz\u2019d again the fallen Gods\nAt sight of the dejected King of Day,\nAnd many hid their faces from the light:\nBut fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes\nAmong the brotherhood; and, at their glare,\nUprose I\u00e4petus, and Cre\u00fcs too,\nAnd Phorcus, sea-born, and together strode\nTo where he towered on his eminence.\nThere those four shouted forth old Saturn\u2019s name;\nHyperion from the peak loud answered, \u201cSaturn!\u201d\nSaturn sat near the Mother of the Gods,\nIn whose face was no joy, though all the Gods\nGave from their hollow throats the name of \u201cSaturn!\u201d\nBook III\nThus in alternate uproar and sad peace,\nAmazed were those Titans utterly.\nO leave them, Muse! O leave them to their woes;\nFor thou art weak to sing such tumults dire:\nA solitary sorrow best befits\nThy lips, and antheming a lonely grief.\nLeave them, O Muse! for thou anon wilt find\nMany a fallen old Divinity\nWandering in vain about bewildered shores.\nMeantime touch piously the Delphic harp,\nAnd not a wind of heaven but will breathe\nIn aid soft warble from the Dorian flute;\nFor lo! \u2019tis for the Father of all verse.\nFlush every thing that hath a vermeil hue,\nLet the rose glow intense and warm the air,\nAnd let the clouds of even and of morn\nFloat in voluptuous fleeces o\u2019er the hills;\nLet the red wine within the goblet boil,\nCold as a bubbling well; let faint-lipp\u2019d shells,\nOn sands, or in great deeps, vermilion turn\nThrough all their labyrinths; and let the maid\nBlush keenly, as with some warm kiss surpris\u2019d.\nChief isle of the embowered Cyclades,\nRejoice, O Delos, with thine olives green,\nAnd poplars, and lawn-shading palms, and beech,\nIn which the Zephyr breathes the loudest song,\nAnd hazels thick, dark-stemm\u2019d beneath the shade:\nApollo is once more the golden theme!\nWhere was he, when the Giant of the Sun\nStood bright, amid the sorrow of his peers?\nTogether had he left his mother fair\nAnd his twin-sister sleeping in their bower,\nAnd in the morning twilight wandered forth\nBeside the osiers of a rivulet,\nFull ankle-deep in lilies of the vale.\nThe nightingale had ceas\u2019d, and a few stars\nWere lingering in the heavens, while the thrush\nBegan calm-throated. Throughout all the isle\nThere was no covert, no retired cave\nUnhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves,\nThough scarcely heard in many a green recess.\nHe listen\u2019d, and he wept, and his bright tears\nWent trickling down the golden bow he held.\nThus with half-shut suffused eyes he stood,\nWhile from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by\nWith solemn step an awful Goddess came,\nAnd there was purport in her looks for him,\nWhich he with eager guess began to read\nPerplex\u2019d, the while melodiously he said:\n\u201cHow cam\u2019st thou over the unfooted sea?\nOr hath that antique mien and robed form\nMov\u2019d in these vales invisible till now?\nSure I have heard those vestments sweeping o\u2019er\nThe fallen leaves, when I have sat alone\nIn cool mid-forest. Surely I have traced\nThe rustle of those ample skirts about\nThese grassy solitudes, and seen the flowers\nLift up their heads, as still the whisper pass\u2019d.\nGoddess! I have beheld those eyes before,\nAnd their eternal calm, and all that face,\nOr I have dream\u2019d.\u201d\u2014\u201cYes,\u201d said the supreme shape,\n\u201cThou hast dream\u2019d of me; and awaking up\nDidst find a lyre all golden by thy side,\nWhose strings touch\u2019d by thy fingers, all the vast\nUnwearied ear of the whole universe\nListen\u2019d in pain and pleasure at the birth\nOf such new tuneful wonder. Is\u2019t not strange\nThat thou shouldst weep, so gifted? Tell me, youth,\nWhat sorrow thou canst feel; for I am sad\nWhen thou dost shed a tear: explain thy griefs\nTo one who in this lonely isle hath been\nThe watcher of thy sleep and hours of life,\nFrom the young day when first thy infant hand\nPluck\u2019d witless the weak flowers, till thine arm\nCould bend that bow heroic to all times.\nShow thy heart\u2019s secret to an ancient Power\nWho hath forsaken old and sacred thrones\nFor prophecies of thee, and for the sake\nOf loveliness new born.\u201d\u2014Apollo then,\nWith sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes,\nThus answer\u2019d, while his white melodious throat\nThrobb\u2019d with the syllables.\u2014\u201cMnemosyne!\nThy name is on my tongue, I know not how;\nWhy should I tell thee what thou so well seest?\nWhy should I strive to show what from thy lips\nWould come no mystery? For me, dark, dark,\nAnd painful vile oblivion seals my eyes:\nI strive to search wherefore I am so sad,\nUntil a melancholy numbs my limbs;\nAnd then upon the grass I sit, and moan,\nLike one who once had wings.\u2014O why should I\nFeel curs\u2019d and thwarted, when the liegeless air\nYields to my step aspirant? why should I\nSpurn the green turf as hateful to my feet?\nGoddess benign, point forth some unknown thing:\nAre there not other regions than this isle?\nWhat are the stars? There is the sun, the sun!\nAnd the most patient brilliance of the moon!\nAnd stars by thousands! Point me out the way\nTo any one particular beauteous star,\nAnd I will flit into it with my lyre,\nAnd make its silvery splendour pant with bliss.\nI have heard the cloudy thunder: Where is power?\nWhose hand, whose essence, what divinity\nMakes this alarum in the elements,\nWhile I here idle listen on the shores\nIn fearless yet in aching ignorance?\nO tell me, lonely Goddess, by thy harp,\nThat waileth every morn and eventide,\nTell me why thus I rave, about these groves!\nMute thou remainest\u2014Mute! yet I can read\nA wondrous lesson in thy silent face:\nKnowledge enormous makes a God of me.\nNames, deeds, gray legends, dire events, rebellions,\nMajesties, sovran voices, agonies,\nCreations and destroyings, all at once\nPour into the wide hollows of my brain,\nAnd deify me, as if some blithe wine\nOr bright elixir peerless I had drunk,\nAnd so become immortal.\u201c\u2014Thus the God,\nWhile his enkindled eyes, with level glance\nBeneath his white soft temples, stedfast kept\nTrembling with light upon Mnemosyne.\nSoon wild commotions shook him, and made flush\nAll the immortal fairness of his limbs;\nMost like the struggle at the gate of death;\nOr liker still to one who should take leave\nOf pale immortal death, and with a pang\nAs hot as death\u2019s is chill, with fierce convulse\nDie into life: so young Apollo anguish\u2019d:\nHis very hair, his golden tresses famed\nKept undulation round his eager neck.\nDuring the pain Mnemosyne upheld\nHer arms as one who prophesied.\u2014At length\nApollo shriek\u2019d;\u2014and lo! from all his limbs\nCelestial\n",

I worry poems are nothing against it. \nMy mama said that if I became a poet or a teacher, I\u2019d make nothing, but \nI\u2019ve thrown words like rocks and hit something in a room when I aimed \nfor a window. One student says when he writes, it feels \nlike nothing can stop him, and his laughter unlocks a door. He invites me \ninto his living.\n",

religiously\nand still go out to work as if it hadn\u2019t happened at all\nOr even me surviving so many incredible tests\nOnce when I was talking to a doctor, I doubted my strength\nHe looked at me incredulously and said, \u201cYou are strong.\u201d\nAnother doctor looked at me\nmy suffering\nAnd asked isn\u2019t anyone there for you?\nAnd another said you deserve to be taken care of\nToday once more I am nursing my broken heart\nCaused by someone who betrayed\nwas not honest\nThat and attending an event and asking white people to give up\ntheir seats to Black people who couldn\u2019t sit down\nAnd seeing social justice in action\nYes I often think of Assotto for the important place\nhe resides in my history\nBut today I am examining his tactics\npulling the tools off the

too haven\u2019t been asked\nI want to interrupt all the proceedings\nall the places Black lesbians have been erased\nand silenced\nLike looking down at a manuscript\nseeing that they asked a young white woman to write about\nBlack queer history\nwhen it\u2019s been my area of expertise\nforever\nOr only attributing \u201980s and \u201990s AIDS activism\nTo ACT UP\nI want the point of outrage now to not only the historicizing of AIDS\nBut the fact that women and Black lesbians\nhave been erased from the dialogue\nWhen there were so many organizations like GMAD\nOther countries ADODI\nMen of All Colors Together\nSalsa Soul/Arican American lesbians united for Societal Change\nLas Buenas Amigas\nand more\nOr asking where are all the Black lesbians on Pose\nbecause certainly they were on the piers and part of that history\nAnd why are white men constantly at the helm\nto tell our stories\nAnd why don\u2019t white queers recognize this\nThat and seeing panel after panel being organized on history and art\nall things important to the world and no one thinking or noticing\nit might be important to have a Black lesbian present\nJust like they kicked Storm\u00e9 out of\nthe Stonewall narrative.\nAnd what about the people who weren\u2019t on the streets\nbut in jobs\nfighting the system\nThe dykes and queers\nmeeting each other forming community\nand connections and families\nand love\nJust like in South Africa where they prevented intermingling\nbut ways were found\nAnd each time we touched or loved\nfound each other in darkness and light\nIt was resistance\nEach time we told each other You\u2019re beautiful\nYou\u2019re not wrong\nIt was resistance\nWhen we stood up to the parents and families\nand courts and those that shunned us\nIt was resistance\nWore what we really wanted\nIt was resistance\nYelled at doctors and drug professionals\nIt was resistance\nEvery time we wrote and read poems\nIt was resistance\nEvery time some queer kid\nstays alive because they saw us\nread us\ndiscovered the archive\nWe\u2019ve won\nEvery war is fought on our bodies\nAnd one day after the gender racial\nsexual orientation wars are over\nin America\nthere will be a new generation\njust like in South Africa called\nthe Born Frees.\n\u20142019\n",

A book one thumbs\nListlessly, till slumber comes.\nUnremembered are her bats\nCircling through the night, her cats\nCrouching in the river reeds,\nStalking gentle flesh that feeds\nBy the river brink; no more\nDoes the bugle-throated roar\nCry that monarch claws have leapt\nFrom the scabbards where they slept.\nSilver snakes that once a year\nDoff the lovely coats you wear,\nSeek no covert in your fear\nLest a mortal eye should see;\nWhat's your nakedness to me?\nHere no leprous flowers rear\nFierce corollas in the air;\nHere no bodies sleek and wet,\nDripping mingled rain and sweat,\nTread the savage measures of\nJungle boys and girls in love.\nWhat is last year's snow to me,\nLast year's anything? The tree\nBudding yearly must forget\nHow its past arose or set\nBough and blossom, flower, fruit,\nEven what shy bird with mute\nWonder at her travail there,\nMeekly labored in its hair.\nOne three centuries removed\nFrom the scenes his fathers loved,\nSpicy grove, cinnamon tree,\nWhat is Africa to me?\nSo I lie, who find no peace\nNight or day, no slight release\nFrom the unremittent beat\nMade by cruel padded feet\nWalking through my body's street.\nUp and down they go, and back,\nTreading out a jungle track.\nSo I lie, who never quite\nSafely sleep from rain at night--\nI can never rest at all\nWhen the rain begins to fall;\nLike a soul gone mad with pain\nI must match its weird refrain;\nEver must I twist and squirm,\nWrithing like a baited worm,\nWhile its primal measures drip\nThrough my body, crying, \"Strip!\nDoff this new exuberance.\nCome and dance the Lover's Dance!\"\nIn an old remembered way\nRain works on me night and day.\nQuaint, outlandish heathen gods\nBlack men fashion out of rods,\nClay, and brittle bits of stone,\nIn a likeness like their own,\nMy conversion came high-priced;\nI belong to Jesus Christ,\nPreacher of humility;\nHeathen gods are naught to me.\nFather, Son, and Holy Ghost,\nSo I make an idle boast;\nJesus of the twice-turned cheek,\nLamb of God, although I speak\nWith my mouth thus, in my heart\nDo I play a double part.\nEver at Thy glowing altar\nMust my heart grow sick and falter,\nWishing He I served were black,\nThinking then it would not lack\nPrecedent of pain to guide it,\nLet who would or might deride it;\nSurely then this flesh would know\nYours had borne a kindred woe.\nLord, I fashion dark gods, too,\nDaring even to give You\nDark despairing features where,\nCrowned with dark rebellious hair,\nPatience wavers just so much as\nMortal grief compels, while touches\nQuick and hot, of anger, rise\nTo smitten cheek and weary eyes.\nLord, forgive me if my need\nSometimes shapes a human creed.\nAll day long and all night through,\nOne thing only must I do:\nQuench my pride and cool my blood,\nLest I perish in the flood.\nLest a hidden ember set\nTimber that I thought was wet\nBurning like the dryest flax,\nMelting like the merest wax,\nLest the grave restore its dead.\nNot yet has my heart or head\nIn the least way realized\nThey and I are civilized.\n",

  "text": "28. It Is Not As If\nIt is not as if I have not been thinking this,\nand it is not as if we have not been thinking this.\nFor what I mean when I will say whiteness, when I will say white\npeople, when I say the whites with such seeming assurance,\nwith such total confidence in the clarity of this locution,\nas if we all know the etymology of this word\u2019s genealogy,\nthe lie of a cluster of marauding nations, building kingdoms\nby destroying kingdoms, we have heard this all before, O Babylon.\nSo, yes, when I say this, what I mean is Babylon, as the Rastas\nhave constructed the notion, in the way of generosity,\nin the way of judgement, in the way of naming the enemy\nof history for who he is, in the inadequate way of symbols,\nin the way of the bible\u2019s total disregard for history, and the prophet\u2019s\ndance in the fulcrum of history, leaping over time and place,\nreturning to the place where we began having learned\nnothing and yet having learned everything language offers us.\nIt is not as if I have not been thinking this.\nIt is not as if we have not been thinking this.\nAnd I want to rehearse Thomas Jefferson and the pragmatism\nof cost, the wisdom of his loyalty to his family\u2019s wealth,\nthe seat of the landed aristocrats reinvented on the plains\nof the New World, the coat of arms, the courtly ambitions,\nthe inventions, the art, the bottles of wine, the French tongue,\nthe legacy, the faux Roman, faux Greek pretension, the envy\nof the nobility of native confederacies, their tongues of fire;\nthe land, the land, the land, and the property of black bodies,\nso much to give up, and who bears the sacrifice, who pays\nthe cost for the preservation of a nation\u2019s ambitions?\nHow he said no to freeing the bodies he said were indebted\nto him for their every breath\u2014the calculus of property;\noh, the rituals of flesh-mongering, the protection of white freedom.\nIt is not as if I have not been thinking this.\nIt is not as if we have not been thinking this,\nAnd Bartholomew de las Casas, Bishop of Chiapas,\nand his Memorial de Remedios para Las Indias,\nthe pragmatic use of Africans, the ones to carry the burden\nof saving the Indians, to save the white man\u2019s soul\u2014\nthis little bishop of pragmatic calculation, correcting sins\nwith more sins. And the bodies of black slave women,\ntheir wombs, studied, tested, reshaped, probed, pierced, tortured,\nwith the whispered promise: \u201cIt will help you, too, it really\nwill and you will be praised for teaching us how to save\nthe wombs of white women, for the cause, all for the cause.\u201d\nAnd Roosevelt and his unfinished revolution, O \u201cdream deferred\u201d,\nO Langston, you tried to sing, how long, not long, how long,\nso long! And Churchill\u2019s rising rhetoric, saying that though cousin\nNazis may ritualize the ancient blood feuds by invading Britain,\nher world-wide empire will rise up and pay the price for protecting\nthe kingdom, the realm, liberty, and so on and so forth. Everyone\nso merciful, everyone so wounded with guilt and gratitude,\neveryone so pragmatic. It is what I am saying, that I am saying\nnothing new, and what I am singing is, Babylon yuh throne gone\ndown, gone down, / Babylon yuh throne gone down.\nIt is not as if I have not been thinking this.\nIt is not as if we have not been thinking this.\nFor no one is blessed with blindness here,\nNo one is blessed with deafness here.\nAnd this thing we see is lurking inside the soft\nalarm of white people who know that they are watching\na slow magical act of erasure, and they know that this is how\nterror manifests itself, quietly, reasonably, and with deadly\nintent.  They are letting black people die.  They are letting\nblack people die in America. Hidden inside the maw\nof these hearts, is the sharp pragmatism of the desperate,\nthe writers of the myth of survival of the fittest,\nor the order of the universe, of Platonic logic, the caste system,\nthe war of the worlds.  They are letting black people die.\nIt is not as if I have not been thinking this.\nNo, it is not as if we have not been thinking this.\nAnd someone is saying, in that soft voice of calm,\n\u201cWell, there will be costs, and those are the costs\nof our liberty.\u201d  Remember when the century turned,\nand the pontiff and pontificators declared that in fifty years,\nthe nation would be brown, and for a decade, the rogue people\nsought to halt this with guns, with terror, with the shutting of borders?\nNow this has arrived, a kind of gift.  Let them die.  The blacks,\nthe poor, the ones who multiply like flies, let them die, and soon\nwe will be lily white again.  Do you think I am paranoid?  I am.\nIt is not as if I have not been thinking this.\nIt is not as if we have not been thinking this.\nAnd paranoia is how we\u2019ve survived.  So, we must march in the streets,\nforce the black people who are immigrant nurses, who are meat packers,\nwho are street cleaners, who are short-order cooks, who are\nthe dregs of society, who are black, who are black, who are black.\nLet them die.  Here in Nebraska, our governor would not release\nthe racial numbers. He says there is no need to cause strife,\nthis is not our problem, he says. We are better than this, he says.\nIt is not as if I have not been thinking this.\nIt is not as if we have not been thinking this.\nAnd so in the silence, we do not know what the purgation is,\nand here in this stumbling prose of mine, this blunt prose of mine,\nis the thing I have not yet said, \u201cThey are trying to kill us,\nthey are trying to kill us, they are trying to kill us off.\u201d\nI sip my comfort.  The dead prophet, his voice broken by cancer,\nhis psalm rises over the darkening plains, \u201cOh yeah, natty Congo\u201d,\nand then the sweetest act of pure resistance, \u201cSpread out! Spread out!\nSpread out!\u201d  We are more than sand on the seashore, so we will not\nget jumpy, we won\u2019t get bumpy, and we won\u2019t walk away, \u201cSpread out!\u201d,\nthey sing in four-part harmony, spears out, Spread out! Spread out!\nIt is not as if I have not been thinking this,\nand it is not as if we have not been thinking this.\nIt is how we survived and how we will continue to survive.\nBut don\u2019t be fooled. These are the betrayals that are gathering\nover the hills.  Help me, I say, help me to see this as something else.\nIt is not as if I have not been thinking this.\nSee? It is not as if we have not all been thinking this.\nIt needs to be blunt and said as you say it.\nI can see and agree and am trying to act, too,\nbut am embroiled in the whiteness I detest.\nYes, as a pacifist, I detest that whiteness\nand see it as the bleaching of shrouds.\nIt makes me ashamed and angry and I fall\ninto nowhere and have no feet and can\u2019t find\nmy way out of it. My hands are the wrong\nshape to hide behind. I see the murderers\nand stand in front of them, refusing\neverything they are. I am weaponless.\nI know guns from my childhood\nand know their sick laugh, their\nself-certainty, their imitations of \u2018sound\u2019\u2014\ntheir chatter. Yes, of course it\u2019s death\nthey make, even when the target\nis a symbol or a bull\u2019s eye\u2014names\nsay it all, underneath\u2014target shooting,\nbut it\u2019s not selective at the end of the breathing,\nthe last bottle of O negative blood, it takes all\nin its recoil as much as its impact, it kills\nlife and it kills death and it is given\nan \u2018out\u2019 through Keats\u2019s white as death\nhalf in love with easeful death\u2019\u2014\na poem I have recited since I was\nsixteen, have recited on the verge of death,\nas if it was a way through when it wasn\u2019t.\nThe poem separated from the hand\nthat wrote it makes a travesty\nof reality\u2014the corpses piling\nup in the feint light of whiteness.\nThe poem was part of the problem\nborn in the eye of empire, the smell\nof hospitals and anatomies, and yet\nI lament his terrible tragic passing.\nI have stood in his deathroom\nand only thought of a young person\nand their overwhelming death,\nthe steps flowing with people\nas now they are empty of both\nRome and world. I think the same\nin the acts of medicine the acts\nof insurance and discrimination,\nand those who take the brunt of economies,\nespecially in Western economies\nthat live off the labour of re-arranged\nand redecorated class alienation.\nWhat you say is true and needs\nto be said in such a way, Kwame.\nI am saying as an aside to all tyranny,\nthat using the methods of the tyrannical\nwill lead to ongoing tyranny. Refusal\nto do anything for them, to stop using their goods,\nto stop giving them anything at all, will soon     bring their collapse.\nTotal and utter refusal. But then, they are\neven prepared for that\u2014bringing\nit all down makes the suffering\nsuffer more via the pain \u2018brought\non themselves.\u2019 That\u2019s tyranny\u2019s propaganda.\n     White bigots and the bigotry\nimplicit in any notion of \u2018whiteness\u2019\nsearch for validation even where\nit is bluntly refused\u2014they enforce\ntheir validation, legitimise themselves\nin every conversation. I guess\nthat might be what Spike Lee\nand Chuck D. have been saying\nforever\u2014the very notion \n\u2018white folk\u2019 have any rights\nof control or even say in other\npeople\u2019s (and peoples\u2019) lives needs\nundoing. Your poem helps protect\nthe vulnerable and thwart the murderous\u2014confront\nthem with its declarations of blackness,\nand that\u2019s as it must be, and you must say,\ngiven the traumatic reality, Kwame.\nSo I listen to Sly Dunbar\nnot to absorb into what I have\nbeen made from, but to reflect\nagainst and learn from\u2014to learn\nis to respect and not just\nbe awed and entertained, those\nshrouds across creativity,\nthose thefts as deadly\nas going armed\nwith intent. I have literally\nplaced flowers in the barrels of guns.\nI will stand between the gun\nand its victim, I will\nbury the arms\ndeeper than rust,\nthe corrosion,\nbeyond even air\nof the grave, beyond\nanything organic, living.\nPeople are meant\nto live!

  "text": "Last night, I visited a captivity story. \nI was sitting in a lean-to made of bark \nwith Ella Ruth, both of us teenagers\u2014 \nher ebony skin, her black hair touching \nher tailbone. I looked at her hard, & \nshe came back to sit beside the fire. \nFrom a slit in the rawhide doorway \nI could see my tribe in surgical masks, \n& as dogs began to howl I woke up.\nStrange how the mind finds tenderness  \neven in captivity. Or how amidst \nthis being held in isolation we dream \nof masks. I see my ancestors, too,  \nat the Carnival of Venice, a bouquet \nof myrrh, viper flesh, & honey \nin the plague doctor\u2019s long beak\u2014 \nthe face of death meant to ward off death. \nThey look back through the silver mirror. \nRemember traveling to Siena, \n& we entered that semi-dark room? \nThose strange garments\u2014the garb \nworn by a secret society of men\u2014 \nmen who wore what we thought \nwere pale KKK robes & masks. \nBut they had cared for the contagious \nsick, & escorted them to the here \n& after, their faces always hidden. \nYes, we descended the Ospedale\u2019s \nwinding stairs stories underground,  \nthrough a long hall to a hidden room  \nwhere a small medieval oil painting hung, \nthe Confraternity of the Night Oratory, \nSt. Catherine of Siena holds the brothers, \ntheir faces coved in hoods & white robes,  \nunder her cloak. They worked shifts  \non behalf of the many struck with plague. \nThe hooded prisoners were led behind \nmedieval-thick walls, into their tiny cells \nwhere solitary penitence was paid twenty- \nthree hours a day. No one dared to speak \nat the Eastern State Penitentiary, eyes \nstaring always at the cold stone floors. \nBeans, flourless bread, shad, lobster, \ncorn, peppers, & a few grains of salt. \nNow, Al Capone had a rug & a radio. \nOn a poor man\u2019s cell block, uncle Gussie, \nwho robbed a bank, spent years  \nin the prison built like a wagon wheel. \nThe low cell door forced him to bow  \nwhen entering; the skylight above\u2014 \nthe Eye of God\u2014a reminder he was watched.  \nWhen his mother died, two brothers,  \na priest & a cop, left sepia photographs  \nof the funeral. Now, cats & ghosts roam. \nLord, this big country. Land of plentitude \nravaged, heart & gut torn out in the name \nof civilization & progress, & just plain old \nunsung unction, low-down skullduggery \n& theurgy. Nature ripped out by thew \ntoned in old world prisons. Horsepower.    \nEven with hard times here, hug the moon \ndevastatingly close, & beat down the door \nwith true love. Wherever you are, bless us. \nYeah, we\u2019ve both known a few in the joint,  \nrobbing Peter to pay Paul, or caught  \nblowing time with this one or that one.  \nSome excuse to keep rats on a wheel, or in a cage.  \nLook, time moves at least twice at once now\u2014 \nback & forth, slow & fast. I held my palm \n on my father\u2019s back when he bent to whisper  \nin the ear of the dead, & two men in black  \ndraped a white handkerchief over a face. \n",

  "author": "Juliana Spahr",
  "text": "^\nBy the end of the year, I was used to\nthings I hadn\u2019t seen before, \nlike a series of street brawls between fa and antifa \nthat often absurdly tumbled \ninto the Berkeley all organic full-of-strollers farmer\u2019s market.\nUsed to hearing about friends\u2019 emails caught up in various FOIAs.\nUsed to the social media posts about how someone somewhere \nwas getting a gun and planned to show up where we worked. \nI should add that the DMs and the @s were rarely realized. \nThe gun never arrived.\nAnd if the threat was made good on it was just that moment when \nsomeone called up my boss and she hung up on them, confused.\nIf there was anything new about this moment\nit was that there was no making sense of what was left and \nright in the way I had previously understood it,\nwhich was as a convention.\nThe DMs came in from all different directions. \nOne day an anonymous white nationalist, \nthe next a well-known comrade angry in love \nand wanting to take it out on someone proximate, \nand then perhaps a blog post from someone \nwho had been perfectly nice when last seen at a poetry reading\nbut now was very upset about something I had implied.\nIt was hard to decipher who was hating what on what day.\nBy the time the state was burning from both ends\nand one end was called Paradise, \nwe didn\u2019t bother with the metaphor. \nInstead we just looked out the window, noticed the smoke, \nshut the window, stayed indoors, and kept on typing.\nLater we joked,\nnow we know what we will be doing when the world burns.\nWe will be shutting the windows and catching up on email\nfinally.\n^\nI\u2019m concerned about these other things. \nOr that is what I thought when they said \nthey were worried I was losing my relationship to poetry.\nIt was still summer.\nStill mid-afternoon.\nThere was a nice breeze.\nWe had half a day of this beauty before us and we knew it. \nUnhurried. Pleasure. \nWe drank a beer that was fresh on the tongue \nin a new way. Light. Almost carbonated.\nThey said they were concerned\nabout me and my relationship to poetry.\nIn the afternoon sun, as the breeze blew softly,\nI first protested to them not about poetry, \nbut about poets. Their nationalism, their acquiescence \nbut also their facebook and twitter accounts.\nTheir brags and their minor attacks, their politics.\nTheir prizes and their publications.\nTheir democratic party affiliations.\nSo I said to them I\u2019m not concerned \nabout my relationship to poetry\nwhich regularly felt to me like that moment \nwhen you open your app and there are a bunch\nof mentions and you haven\u2019t posted anything a while\nand all you can do is say today is so FML and start to work through them.\nThis is not the same as the oh no way of the Berkeley farmer\u2019s market brawl,\nnot the state burning and burning again,\nbut still, how to write an epiphanic possibility in this sociality?\nI had written for so long about being together, \nabout how we were together like it or not.\nI had used a metaphor of breath and of space.\nI had embraced the epiphanic \nnot just at the end of the poem, as was the lyric convention,\nbut sometimes I even made the whole poem epiphanic.\nAnd that I couldn\u2019t do anymore.\nLately there wasn\u2019t any singing that I could hear. \nJust attempts. Dark times. \nNothing about this terrible moment was new though.\nIt has always been a terrible moment.\nAnd there have always been poets too.\nAnd always poets writing the terrible nation into existence.\nThis is one reason I will never get a tramp stamp that says\npoetry is my boyfriend.\n^\nI thought for a while there were two sorts of poets.\nPoets who write the terrible nation into existence\nand poets screwing around doing something else.\nFor years I was on team poets screwing around doing something else.\nFor years I had used poetry to slip away, \nelude the hold of the family, the coupleform, the policing of tradition, \nto pry open time into an endless stretch of possibility.\nIn that room where we try to pry open possibility.\nWhen I first heard the avant garde \nI heard it as an opening. A door. A window,\nMaybe a garage door.\nA hole in the wall I could shimmy through.\nI heard it as an opening. All sorts of openings.\nI could make the hole. \nOr my pink crowbar could.\nI would be writing and I would fall into the singing,\nThat whoosh. The singing whoosh.\nAnd because at first I saw myself as someone who wanted\nan opening in the tradition,\nI split this whoosh up all the time. \nI fragmented it into words or took away its deictics.\nAnother friend, a poet, who no longer talks to me \nonce gave me the image of the pink crowbar \nas a way of thinking about writing. \nLosing her was a loss all around. \nBut to compensate for that loss \nI think often about pulling something open.\nAlthough I\u2019m fairly convinced she would grab \nthe pink crowbar out of my hand if she saw me wielding it.\nFor years, there was that perfect moment after the reading\nwhere we had to leave the bar because \nthe couples were coming to buy their cocktails \nand we couldn\u2019t figure out where to go.\nMaybe it was Friday or Saturday night and all the bars\nwere full of people who were not talking about poetry\nso we kept walking, looking in each bar and each one wrong.\nEventually the streets opened up and we were at the bridge\nand there was a river and we walked across the open space to it\nand climbed down its sides and sat there. \nWe had bought some beers and a small glass flask of whiskey from a bodega.\nWe carried the cans and the flask in brown bags as a convention.\nBut we did not need this convention. \nIf there was law, the law drove by, didn\u2019t stop. \nOther things were. Night. Maybe moon. Water. Rats.\nSometimes drugs were involved.\nWe walked through Wall Street at 3 am and \nwe rattled the locked doors of all the buildings, laughing\nat their absurdity because we knew where it was at\nand at was rattling the doors. \n^\nDuring these days,\nI would wake up and my head would hurt \nand then I would realize that in my dream \nI had said to myself that I should write some poetry.\nBut my dreams never explained to me why. \nOr how.\nHow to sing in these dark times?\nIt is true that I have been with poetry for a long time. \nSince I was a teenager.\nThose loves of many years and our bodies changing together.\nAnd yet also the deepening of this love. Despite.\nThat day with the breeze in the bar\nAnd we said together, there needs to be some pleasure in the world. \nAnd next, poetry is the what is left of life.\nAnd we pledged, more singing.\nAnd we referenced by saying,\nIn the dark times. Will there also be singing? \nYes, there will also be singing. About the dark times.\n^\nAt night I thought if I just read all of Brecht, \nI would maybe find the singing.\nSo I began to read Brecht that night, \nin bed with my son while he too read before he went to sleep.\nThere was a new edition. \nIt was hard to hold because it was so big.\nI rested it on a pillow and I rested my head on a pillow\nand I turned the pages looking for the singing.\nI couldn\u2019t find the singing.\nAfter I started reading Brecht, \nI began sorting through my books. I had too many. \nAs I pulled them off the shelves, blew off the dust,\nI asked myself would I need it if there was a revolution.\nIt turned out that I thought I would for sure need\nfive translations of the Odyssey\nand all the books of Susan Howe.\nI kept all the plant books too.\nThe comfort of the Jespen Manual of Vascular Plants of California.\nIt\u2019s an open question if the revolution will still need poetry,\nits tradition and its resistance to that tradition.\nBut it will for sure need the Vascular Plants of California.\n^\nIt\u2019s always been a terrible moment.\nBut now I understand it as even more terrible.\nThe nation is for sure not my boyfriend.\nBut the land it claims,\nthough I don\u2019t claim it,\nI hold my love for this land on my underside, \nin a small pocket that eventually bursts to release my love spores.\nI mean it is not a casual love. \nIt is though a difficult one. Threatened. Invaded.\nA friend is dying\nas the scotch broom is putting out its nitrogen fixing roots\nbut our friendship died years before \nthe seed pods open explosively\nanother friend has cancer\nand last for eighty years\nand yet another friend now in the world in some new way\nbut they are hard and survive rough transport through water\nand mainly it was all the information \nfleshy and full of proteins in a way that interests ants \nwe suddenly knew about everything\nas the ants carry the seeds back to their nests creating dense infestations. \nA mixture of hell. A metaphor of resilience.\nThe scotch broom has so many tricks.\nGrows in patches and as scattered individuals\nwith a total cover of about 15 percent and 35 percent, respectively.\nAs does the Tree of Heaven.\nThere is no space too polluted for it. \nIt absorbs sulfur dioxide in its leaves.\nIt can withstand cement dust and fumes from coal tar operations, \nas well as resist ozone exposure relatively well. \nEven mercury. \nIt grows fast, and even faster in California.\nAnd once it starts, it shows up everywhere,\nimpossible to destroy.\nLoves the fires.\nEverything. Never ending.\nEverything. Yet to come.\nAnd yet the world and the leaves continue to exist. \nYellow veins. Flowers.\nLarge, compound leaves. \nArranged. Alternately on the stem.\n11-33 leaflets. Occasionally up to 41.\nOne to three teeth on each side. Close to the base. \nEverything. Small.\nYellow-green to reddish. Flowers.\nEverything. Panicles up to 30 cm long.\nEverything.\n",

  "author": "Angelo Geter",
  "text": "So When I was a kid I had this great fascination with sports.\nFrom soccer to football to tennis\nI played any game that involved a ball and a competition I could win.\nFavorite sport of all time was basketball.\nI wanted to be like MJ and play in the NBA.\nSo everyday after school I would practice layups, jumpers and triple threat stance\nUntil the street lights came on.\nHoping that one day I would make it to the league.\nIf you haven\u2019t figured it out by now,\nThat career ain\u2019t quite work out for me.\nNow I work here and write poems.\nBut I was always a fan of any game I put my heart\nMind, body and soul completely into.\nExcept when it came to the game of love.\nSee when it came to the game of love\nI was more like a rookie.\nA benchwarmer trying to fight my way\ninto the starting lineup.\nI was never on the first string.\nNever picked up on the first run,\nSo I had to sit on the sidelines and watch\nOther players score when I was struggling to get a shot.\nI had to find out very quickly\nThat some women will always put you on their roster,\nBut would rather choose men with less skills\nAnd more swag.\nMore J\u2019s than A\u2019s.\nMore willing to run and shoot than to throw you an assist.\nObsessed with tight ends who only wanted\nTo touchdown between your legs.\nMark your private parts on their scoresheet\nRank you on their ESPN top lays of the week\nAnd then when they traded you for a new pick,\nYou always came running back to us.\nSee relationships are alot like sports.\nEveryone wants to play but no one shows up to practice.\nPut in the hard work on the hardwood,\nGrind for glory on the gridiron.\nFight on the ice.\nGo the distance for 12 rounds \u2018cause this is more than just a game\nFrom the first kiss to the first fight\nYou will find yourself in nonstop action.\nYour first date is a scrimmage,\nWhere both sides are feeling each other out\nTrying to determine if you are worthy of playing time.\nYour argument is a heavyweight fight\nFull of low blows and sucker punches\nJabs and uppercuts designed to KO your opponent.\nThe first time you show your physical love\nWill probably be after that first argument.\nAnd if it ya\u2019ll make sure it feels like the olympics.\nMake her long jump from long strokes.\nTurn his baton in a pole vault.\nTurn a javelin into a discus until it shotputs\nAnd then when you are done remember to never\nMake them jump over hurdles for your affection.\nTreat them like your star player.\nThe only option in your triple threat offense.\nCause if you don\u2019t, there will always\nbe players on the sidelines waiting to get drafted.\nFans in the stands\nLooking for you to drop the ball so they can pick up your fumbles\nSo if you want them\nThen show how them that you want them\nPut down your guards and power forward\nBy making them the center of your attention.\nTreat them like your teammate and not your sparring partner.\n\u2018Cause relationships don\u2019t come with playbooks.\nNo sets and schemes to beat the opposing team.\nYou have to play as you go, work out\nPut in the overtime hoping that you can win the game\nBut remember ya\u2019ll this is more than just a game,\nIt\u2019s an experience.\nSee in the game of tennis, when a player has yet to score a point\nIn a match it is called \u201clove\u201d.\nCause they know it's not about keeping score.\nIt's about starting with nothing and adding more on top\nTo build something beautiful.\nAnd ya\u2019ll love is beautiful.\nLove is the only competition worth living and dying for\nSo we run suicides\nCause sometimes you have to kill the person you are\nIn order to birth the lover you\u2019re meant to become.\nSo, no I am not in the NBA.\nI will never get drafted to play in the major leagues.\nBut every time I look at the scoreboards in her eyes I\nknow there is no way in the world\nI could possibly ever lose.\n",

  "title": "Ode to Butter",
  "author": "Beth Ann Fennelly",
  "text": "Like everything delicious, I was warned against it.\nThose mornings, I\u2019d slowly descend the stairs\nin my plaid Catholic school uniform skirt, find my parents\neating behind newspapers, coned in separate silences.\nThe only music was the throat-clearing rasp of toast\nbeing scraped with too-little butter, three passes\nof the blade, kkrrrrr, kkrrrr, kkrrr, battle hymn of the eighties.\nWhen I pulled the butter close, my mother\u2019s eyes\nwould twitch to my knife, measuring my measuring--\nthe goal, she\u2019d shared from Weight Watchers,\na pat so thin the light shines through. If I disobeyed,\nindulged, slathered my toast to glistening lace,\nI\u2019d earn her favorite admonition, predictable as Sunday\u2019s\ndry communion wafer: \u201cA moment on the lips . . .\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t stop my head from chiming, forever on the hips.\nHips? They were my other dangerous excess.\nI was growing them in secret beneath my skirt,\nand when I walked the dog after breakfast\nand a truck whooshed past from behind, the trucker\u2019s eyes\nsizzling mine in his rear view, I knew my secret\nwouldn\u2019t stay a secret long. They were paired, up top,\nby a swelling, flesh rising like cream to fill, then overfill\nthe frothy training bra. Everything softening on the shelf,\nmilk-made. Meanwhile, at breakfast, sitting on my secret,\nI\u2019d concede, scrape kkrrrrr, kkrrrr, kkrrr, lay down\nmy weapon, dry toast sticking in my craw. I\u2019d think\nof the girl from school, seventeen to my fourteen,\nwho crawled out the window of first-period bio\nto meet her boyfriend from the Navy base. She\u2019d collar\nhis peacoat, draw his mouth to her white neck,\nor so I kept imagining. Slut, the girls whispered, watching\nher struggling back through the window, throat\npinked from cold and his jaw\u2019s dark stubble,\nkkrrrrr, kkrrrr, kkrrr. Only fourth period,\nand already I was hungry for lunch, or something.\nThank you, Republican parents, thank you,\nCatholic education, thank you, Reganomics\u2014\nwords I never knew I\u2019d write. But I hereby acknowledge\nrepression\u2019s inadvertent gifts. Folks who came of age\nin liberal families, permissive cities, the free-love sixties,\nhow far they must go to transgress\u2014\nVegas, latex, sex tapes, a sugaring of the nostrils?\nYet how close at hand rebellion is for me.\nMerely making married love with my married husband,\nI\u2019m a filthy whore. Merely sitting down to breakfast\nand raising the butter knife, I\u2019m living on the edge.\n",

They must have sensed\nfear flashing in their uteruses, and wondered\nwhat locust larvae lay dormant beneath the goldenrod,\nboring their tender limbs, reminding them\nof limpid skies, how bound they were to things living.\nSome days they gathered to celebrate the family\u2014\nSundays in the sun, young lovers with nests\nfull of babies, old lovers with memories cradled\nin their brows. Circled beneath a canopy of oaks,\nthey boiled blue crabs and crawfish in an open flame.\nThey told their stories with songs and black-and-white\nphotographs, between shuffled cards and dots counted\non small ivory stones. Now, four hand fans later,\nthe sisters speak of fallen branches. They take refuge\nin beveled mirrors, in quiet times with questions\ndangling in a slipknot. From their necks hang\nhand-knitted scarves and the albatrosses\nof pain not forgiven, salutations written but not sent.\nStill, they wait to see patterns quilted for the spring\nbazaar, the evergreens blooming in their winters.\nThrough the lives of their great grandchildren unborn,\nthey wait, silent about their steep climbs and falls.\n",

But no name. \nThe Bricoleur explained: If I give you a name, they will come for you. Meanwhile, near the wall,\nreal soldiers studied the boy\u2019s earlier entrance. Surveillance video showed his little body dancing\nthrough the metal slats like a knock. They had his image but no name. When they plastered his\nface over town, people were unable to tell whether they were looking at a person or a light bulb. \nIf only we knew his name, the townsfolk clamored. They were as restless as gibbons in a zoo.\nUndisturbed, the boy grew into a train. He ran cross country & became sinewy & kind. The \ntownsfolk knew him as Snapdragon & S\u014dzu & Graceful Hand. The boys on the track team called\nhim Saguaro, which was closest to the name he carried inside. Soon the Bricoleur passed on to \nthe next world. The boy spent years in a half-dead state, roaming alleys with his xolo looking for \nalms. This is why, when the doctor appeared, he was able to earn her light. She had come from \nthe same town & the same source on the other side of the wall. The courtship was quick & they\nplanned to wed in the giant cathedral at the center of town. The townsfolk, who were now better\nknown as family, occupied every pew. At the altar, after the ceremony of sand, the priest, in\npreparation for the vows, asked their names. Citlali, the girl said. The boy paused & then, \nthinking that time absolves, spoke his name into the hall. The audience, the bride, & the priest\nhimself set upon the boy.\n",

They sleep well\nand stay out late, their nerves coiled neatly inside\ntheir grown bodies.

There is a world of difference: the distance\nbetween habitable worlds. It is the space that is\nunbearable. The poem is relieved not to have to live\nin it. Instead, its heart ticks perfectly unfretfully\namong the trees. The children who are not in the poem\ndo not cast shadows or spells to make themselves\nappear. When they don\u2019t walk through the poem, time\ndoes not bend around them. They are not black holes.\nThere are already so many nots in this poem, it is already\nso negatively charged. The field around the poem\nis summoning children and shadows and singularities\nfrom a busy land full of breathing and mass. My non-\nchildren are pulling children away from their own\nwarm worlds. They will arrive before I can stop them.\nWhen matter meets anti-matter, it annihilates into\nsomething new. Light. Sound. Waves and waves\nof something like water.

  "author": "Philip Freneau",
  "text": "This American world, all our histories say,\nSecluded from Europe, long centuries lay,\nAnd peopled by beings whom white-men detest,\nThe sons of the Tartars, that came from the west.\nThese Indians, \u2018tis certain, were here long before ye all,\nAnd dwelt in their wigwams from time immemorial;\nIn a mere state of nature, untutored, untaught,\nThey did as they pleased, and they spoke as they thought\u2014\nNo priests they had then for the cure of their souls,\nNo lawyers, recorders, or keepers of rolls;\nNo learned physicians vile nostrums concealed\u2014\nTheir druggist was Nature\u2014her shop was the field.\nIn the midst of their forests how happy and blest,\nIn the skin of a bear or buffalo drest!\nNo care to perplex, and no luxury seen\nBut the feast, and the song, and the dance on the green.\nSome bowed to the moon, and some worshipped the sun,\nAnd the king and the captain were centered in one;\nIn a cabin they met, in their councils of state,\nWhere age and experience alone might debate.\nWith quibbles they never essayed to beguile,\nAnd Nature had taught them the orator's style;\nNo pomp they affected, not quaintly refined\nThe nervous idea that glanced on the mind.\nWhen hunting or battle invited to arms,\nThe women they left to take care of their farms\u2014\nThe toils of the summer did winter repay,\nWhile snug in their cabins they snored it away.\nIf death came among them his dues to demand,\nThey still had some prospects of comfort at hand\u2014\nThe dead man they sent to the regions of bliss,\nWith his bottle and dog, and his fair maids to kiss.\nThus happy they dwelt in a rural domain,\nUninstructed in commerce, unpractised in gain,\n\u2019Till, taught by the loadstone to traverse the seas,\nColumbus came over, that bold Genoese.\nFrom records authentic, the date we can shew,\nOne thousand four hundred and ninety and two\nYears, borne by the seasons, had vanished away,\nSince the babe in the manger at Bethlehem lay.\nWhat an \u00e6ra was this, above all that had passed,\nTo yield such a treasure, discovered at last\u2014\nA new world, in value exceeding the old,\nSuch mountains of silver, such torrents of gold!\nYet the schemes of Columbus, however well planned\nWere scarcely sufficient to find the main land;\nOn the islands alone with the natives he spoke,\nExcept when he entered the great Oronoque:\nIn this he resembled old Moses, the Jew,\nWho, roving about with his wrong-headed crew,\nWhen at length the reward was no longer denied,\nFrom the top of Mount Pisgah he saw it, and died.\nThese islands and worlds in the watery expanse,\nLike most mighty things, were the offspring of chance,\nSince steering for Asia, Columbus they say,\nWas astonished to find such a world in his way!\nNo wonder, indeed, he was smit with surprize\u2014\nThis empire of Nature was new to their eyes\u2014\nCut short in their course by so splendid a scene,\nSuch a region of wonders intruding between!\nYet great as he was, and deserving no doubt,\nWe have only to thank him for finding the rout;\nThese climes to the northward, more stormy and cold,\nWere reserved for the efforts of Cabot the bold.\nWhere the sun in December appears to decline\nFar off to the southward, and south of the line,\nA merchant of Florence, more fortunate still,\nExplored a new track, and discovered Brazil:\nGood Fortune, Vespucius, pronounced thee her own,\nOr else to mankind thou hadst scarcely been known\u2014\nBy giving thy name, thou art ever renowned\u2014\nThy name to a world that another had found!\nColumbia, the name was, that merit decreed,\nBut Fortune and Merit have never agreed\u2014\nYet the poets, alone, with commendable care\nAre vainly attempting the wrong to repair.\nThe bounds I prescribe to my verse are too narrow\nTo tell of the conquests of Francis Pizarro;\nAnd Cortez \u2019tis needless to bring into view,\nOne Mexico conquered, the other Peru.\nMontezuma with credit in verse might be read,\nBut Dryden has told you the monarch is dead!\nAnd the woes of his subjects\u2014what torments they bore,\nLas Casas, good bishop, has mentioned before:\nLet others be fond of their stanzas of grief\u2014\nI hate to descant on the fall of the leaf\u2014\nTwo scenes are so gloomy, I view them with pain,\nThe annals of death, and the triumphs of Spain.\nPoor Atahualpa we cannot forget\u2014\nHe gave them his utmost\u2014yet died in their debt,\nHis wealth was a crime that they could not forgive,\nAnd when they possessed it, forbade him to live.\nForedoomed to misfortunes (that come not alone)\nHe was the twelfth Inca that sat on the throne,\nWho fleecing his brother of half his domains,\nAt the palace of Cusco confined him in chains.\nBut what am I talking\u2014or where do I roam?\n\u2019Tis time that our story was brought nearer home\u2014\nFrom Florida\u2019s cape did Cabot explore\nTo the fast frozen region of cold Labradore.\nIn the year fourteen hundred and ninety and eight\nHe came, as the annals of England relate,\nBut finding no gold in the lengthy domain,\nAnd coasting the country, he left it again.\nNext Davis\u2014then Hudson adventured, they say,\nOne found out a streight, and the other a bay,\nWhose desolate region, or turbulent wave\nOne present bestowed him\u2014and that was a grave.\nIn the reign of a virgin (as authors discover)\nDrake, Hawkins, and Raleigh in squadrons came over\nWhile Barlow and Grenville succeeded to these,\nWho all brought their colonies over the seas.\nThese, left in a wilderness teeming with woes,\nThe natives, suspicious, concluded them foes,\nAnd murdered them all without notice or warning,\nRalph Lane, with his vagabonds, scarcely returning.\nIn the reign of king James (and the first of the name,)\nGeorge Summers, with Hacluit, to Chesapeake came,\nWhere far in the forests, not doomed to renown,\nOn the river Powhatan they built the first town.\nTwelve years after this, some scores of dissenters\nTo the northernmost district came seeking adventures;\nOutdone by the bishops, those great faggot fighters;\nThey left them to rule with their cassocks and mitres.\nThus banished forever, and leaving the sod,\nThe first land they saw was the pitch of Cape Cod,\nWhere famished with hunger and quaking with cold\nThey planned their New-Plymouth\u2014so called from the old.\nThey were, without doubt, a delightful collection;\u2014\nSome came to be rid of a Stuart\u2019s direction,\nSome sailed with a view to dominion and riches,\nSome to pray without book, and a few to hang witches.\nSome, came on the Indians to shed a new light,\nConvinced long before that their own must be right,\nAnd that all who had died in the centuries past\nOn the devil\u2019s lee shore were eternally cast.\nThese exiles were formed in a whimsical mould,\nAnd were awed by their priests, like the Hebrews of old;\nDisclaimed all pretences to jesting and laughter,\nAnd sighed their lives through, to be happy hereafter.\nOn a crown immaterial their hearts were intent,\nThey looked towards Zion, wherever they went,\nDid all things in hopes of a future reward,\nAnd worried mankind\u2014for the sake of the Lord.\nWith rigour excessive they strengthened their reign,\nTheir laws were conceived in the ill-natured strain,\nWith mystical meanings the saint was perplext,\nAnd the flesh and the devil were slain by a text.\nThe body was scourged, for the good of the soul,\nAll folly discouraged by peevish controul,\nA knot on the head was the sign of no grace,\nAnd the Pope and his comrade were pictured in lace.\nA stove in their churches, or pews lined with green,\nWere horrid to think of, much more to be seen,\nTheir bodies were warmed with the linings of love,\nAnd the fire was sufficient that flashed from above.\n\u2019Twas a crime to assert that the moon was opaque,\nTo say the earth moved, was to merit the stake;\nAnd he that could tell an eclipse was to be,\nIn the college of Satan had took his degree.\nOn Sundays their faces were dark as a cloud\u2014\nThe road to the meeting was only allowed,\nAnd those they caught rambling, on business or pleasure,\nWere sent to the stocks, to repent at their leisure.\nThis day was the mournfullest day in the week\u2014\nExcept on religion, none ventured to speak\u2014\nThis day was the day to examine their lives,\nTo clear off old scores, and to preach to their wives.\nTheir houses were forts, that seemed proof against light;\nTheir parlours, all day, were the blackness of night:\nAnd, as if at their thresholds a cannon did roar,\nThe animals hardly dared open their door\n'Till the sun disappeared\u2014then, like a mole's snout\nIn the dusk of the evening, their noses popped out.\nIn the school of oppression though woefully taught,\n\u2019Twas only to be the oppressors they sought;\nAll, all but themselves were be-deviled and blind,\nAnd their narrow-souled creed was to serve all mankind.\nThis beautiful system of nature below\nThey neither considered, nor wanted to know,\nAnd called it a dog-house wherein they were pent,\nUnworthy themselves, and their mighty descent.\nThey never perceived that in Nature's wide plan\nThere must be that whimsical creature called Man,\nFar short of the rank he affects to attain,\nYet a link in its place, in creation's vast chain.\nWhatever is foreign to us and our kind\nCan never be lasting, though seemingly joined\u2014\nThe hive swarmed at length, and a tribe that was teazed\nSet out for Rhode-Island to think as they pleased.\nSome hundreds to Britain ran murmuring home\u2014\nWhile others went off in the forests to roam,\nWhen they found they had missed what they looked for at first,\nThe downfall of sin, and the reign of the just.\nHence, dry controversial reflections were thrown,\nAnd the old dons were vexed in the way they had shown;\nSo those that are held in the work-house all night\nThrow dirt the next day at the doors, out of spite.\nAh pity the wretches that lived in those days,\n(Ye modern admirers of novels and plays)\nWhen nothing was suffered but musty, dull rules,\nAnd nonsense from Mather and stuff from the schools!\nNo story, like Rachel's, could tempt them to sigh,\nSusanna and Judith employed the bright eye\u2014\nNo fine spun adventures tormented the breast,\nLike our modern Clarissa, Tom Jones, and the rest.\nThose tyrants had chosen the books for your shelves,\n(And, trust me, no other than writ by themselves,\nFor always by this may a bigot be known,\nHe speaks well of nothing but what is his own.)\nFrom indwelling evil these souls to release,\nThe Quakers arrived with their kingdom of peace\u2014\nBut some were transported and some bore the lash,\nAnd four they hanged fairly, for preaching up trash.\nThe lands of New-England (of which we now treat)\nWere famous, ere that, for producing of wheat;\nBut the soil (or tradition says strangely amiss)\nHas been pestered with pumpkins from that day to this.\nThus, feuds and vexations distracted their reign,\n(And perhaps a few vestiges still may remain)\nBut time has presented an offspring as bold,\nLess free to believe, and more wise than the old.\nTheir phantoms, their wizzards, their witches are fled,\nMatthew Paris's story with horror is read\u2014\nHis daughters, and all the enchantments they bore\u2014\nAnd the demon, that pinched them, is heard of no more.\nTheir taste for the fine arts is strangely increased,\nAnd Latin's no longer a mark of the beast:\nMathematics, at present, a farmer may know,\nWithout being hanged for connections below.\nProud, rough, Independent, undaunted and free,\nAnd patient of hardships, their task is the sea,\nTheir country too barren their wish to attain,\nThey make up the loss by exploring the main.\nWherever bright Ph\u0153bus awakens the gales\nI see the bold Yankees expanding their sails,\nThroughout the wide ocean pursuing their schemes,\nAnd chacing the whales on its uttermost streams.\nNo climate, for them, is too cold or too warm,\nThey reef the broad canvass, and fight with the storm;\nIn war with the foremost their standards display,\nOr glut the loud cannon with death, for the fray.\nNo valour in fable their valour exceeds,\nTheir spirits are fitted for desperate deeds;\nNo rivals have they in our annals of fame,\nOr if they are rivalled, \u2019tis York has the claim.\nInspired at the sound, while the name she repeats,\nBold Fancy conveys me to Hudson\u2019s retreats\u2014\nAh, sweet recollection of juvenile dreams\nIn the groves, and the forests that skirted his streams!\nHow often, with rapture, those streams were surveyed,\nWhen, sick of the city, I flew to the shade\u2014\nHow often the bard, and the peasant shall mourn\nEre those groves shall revive, or those shades shall return!\nNot a hill, but some fortress disfigures it round!\nAnd ramparts are raised where the cottage was found!\nThe plains and the vallies with ruin are spread,\nWith graves in abundance, and bones of the dead.\nThe first that attempted to enter the streight\n(In anno one thousand six hundred and eight)\nWas Hudson (the same that we mentioned before,\nWho was lost in the gulph that he went to explore.)\nFor a sum that they paid him (we know not how much)\nThis captain transferred all his right to the Dutch;\nFor the time has been here, (to the world be it known,)\nWhen all a man sailed by, or saw, was his own.\nThe Dutch on their purchase sat quietly down,\nAnd fixed on an island to lay out a town;\nThey modelled their streets from the horns of a ram,\nAnd the name that best pleased them was, New Amsterdam.\nThey purchased large tracts from the Indians for beads,\nAnd sadly tormented some runaway Swedes,\nWho (none knows for what) from their country had flown,\nTo live here in peace, undisturbed and alone.\nNew Belgia, the Dutch called their province, be sure,\nBut names never yet made possession secure,\nFor Charley (the second that honoured the name)\nSent over a squadron, asserting his claim:\n(Had his sword and his title been equally slender,\nIn vain had they summoned Mynheer to surrender)\nThe soil they demanded, or threatened their worst,\nInsisting that Cabot had looked at it first.\nThe want of a squadron to fall on their rear\nMade the argument perfectly plain to Mynheer\u2014\nForce ended the contest\u2014the right was a sham,\nAnd the Dutch were sent packing to hot Surinam.\n\u2019Twas hard to be thus of their labours deprived,\nBut the age of Republics had not yet arrived\u2014\nFate saw\u2014though no wizzard could tell them as much\u2014\nThat the crown, in due time, was to fare like the Dutch.\n",

the dictates of the muse,\nTo paint the terrors of the infernal place,\nAnd fiends from Europe, insolent as base.\n  Assist me, Clio! while in verse I tell\nThe dire misfortunes that a ship befell,\nWhich outward bound, to St. Eustatia's shore,\nDeath and disaster through the billows bore.\n  From Philadelphia's crowded port she came;\nFor there the builder plann'd her lofty frame,\nWith wond'rous skill, and excellence of art\nHe form'd, dispos'd, and order'd every part,\nWith joy beheld the stately fabric rise\nTo a stout bulwark of stupendous size,\n'Till launch'd at last, capacious of the freight,\nHe left her to the Pilots, and her fate.\n  First from her depths the tapering masts ascend,\nOn whose firm bulk the transverse yards depend,\nBy shrouds and stays secur'd from side to side\nTrees grew on trees, suspended o'er the tide,\nFirm to the yards extended, broad and vast\nThey hung the sails susceptive of the blast,\nFar o'er the prow the lengthy bowsprit lay,\nSupporting on the extreme the taught Gib-stay,\nTwice ten six pounders at their port holes plac'd\nAnd rang'd in rows, stood hostile in the waist:\nThus all prepar'd, impatient for the seas,\nShe left her station with an adverse breeze,\nThis her first outset from her native shore,\nTo seas a stranger, and untry'd before.\n  From the bright radiance that his glories spread\nEre from the east gay Ph\u0153bus lifts his head,\nFrom the sweet morn, a kindred name she won,\nAurora call'd, the offspring of the sun,\nWhose form projecting, the broad prow displays,\nFar glittering o'er the wave, a mimic blaze.\n  The gay ship now, in all her pomp and pride,\nWith sails expanded, flew along the tide;\n'Twas thy deep stream, O Delaware, that bore\nThis pile intended for a southern shore,\nBound to those isles where endless summer reigns,\nFair fruits, gay blossoms, and enamell'd plains;\nWhere sloping lawns the roving swain invite,\nAnd the cool morn succeeds the breezy night,\nWhere each glad day a heaven unclouded brings\nAnd sky-topt mountains teem with golden springs.\n  From Cape Henlopen, urg'd by favouring gales,\nWhen morn emerg'd, we sea-ward spread our sails,\nThen east-south-east explor'd the briny way,\nClose to the wind, departing from the bay;\nNo longer seen the hoarse resounding strand,\nWith hearts elate we hurried from the land,\nEscap'd the dangers of that shelvy ground,\nTo sailors fatal, and for wrecks renown'd.\u2014\n  The gale increases as we stem the main,\nNow scarce the hills their sky-blue mist retain,\nAt last they sink beneath the rolling wave\nThat seems their summits, as they sink, to lave;\nAbaft the beam the freshening breezes play,\nNo mists advancing to deform the day,\nNo tempests rising o'er the splendid scene,\nA sea unruffled, and a heaven serene.\n  Now Sol's bright lamp, the heav'n born source of light,\nHad pass'd the line of his meridian height,\nAnd westward hung\u2014retreating from the view\nShores disappear'd, and every hill withdrew,\nWhen, still suspicious of some neighbouring foe,\nAloft the Master bade a Seaman go,\nTo mark if, from the mast's aspiring height\nThrough all the round a vessel came in sight.\n  Too soon the Seaman's glance, extending wide,\nFar distant in the east a ship espy'd,\nHer lofty masts stood bending to the gale,\nClose to the wind was brac'd each shivering sail;\nNext from the deck we saw the approaching foe,\nHer spangled bottom seem'd in flames to glow\nWhen to the winds she bow'd in dreadful haste\nAnd her lee-guns lay delug'd in the waste:\nFrom her top-gallant flow'd an English Jack;\nWith all her might she strove to gain our track,\nNor strove in vain\u2014with pride and power elate,\nWing'd on by hell, she drove us to our fate;\nNo stop no stay her bloody crew intends,\n(So flies a comet with its host of fiends)\nNor oaths, nor prayers arrest her swift career,\nDeath in her front, and ruin in her rear.\n  Struck at the sight, the Master gave command\nTo change our course, and steer toward the land\u2014\nSwift to the task the ready sailors run,\nAnd while the word was utter'd, half was done:\nAs from the south the fiercer breezes rise\nSwift from her foe alarm'd Aurora flies,\nWith every sail extended to the wind\nShe fled the unequal foe that chac'd behind;\nAlong her decks dispos'd in close array\nEach at its port, the grim artillery lay,\nSoon on the foe with brazen throat to roar;\nBut, small their size, and narrow was their bore;\nYet faithful they their destin'd station keep\nTo guard the barque that wafts them o'er the deep,\nWho now must bend to steer a homeward course\nAnd trust her swiftness rather than her force,\nUnfit to combat with a powerful foe;\nHer decks too open, and her waist too low.\n  While o'er the wave with foaming prow she flies,\nOnce more emerging, distant landscapes rise;\nHigh in the air the starry streamer plays,\nAnd every sail its various tribute pays:\nTo gain the land we bore the weighty blast;\nAnd now the wish'd for cape appear'd at last;\nBut the vext foe, impatient of delay,\nPrepar'd for ruin, press'd upon her prey;\nNear, and more near, in aweful grandeur came\nThe frigate Iris, not unknown to fame;\nIris her name, but Hancock once she bore,\nFram'd and completed on New Albion's shore,\nBy Manly lost, the swiftest of the train\nThat fly with wings of canvas o'er the main.\n  Now, while for combat some with zeal prepare,\nThus to the heavens the Boatswain sent his prayer:\n\"List, all ye powers that rule the skies and seas!\n\"Shower down perdition on such thieves as these,\n\"Fate, strike their hearts with terror and dismay,\n\"And sprinkle on their powder salt-sea spray!\n\"May bursting cannon, while his aim he tries,\n\"Destroy the Gunner, and be-damn his eyes\u2014\n\"The chief who awes the quarter-deck, may he,\n\"Tripp'd from his stand, be tumbled in the sea.\n\"May they who rule the round-top's giddy height\n\"Be canted headlong to perpetual night;\n\"May fiends torment them on a leeward coast,\n\"And help forsake them when they want it most\u2014\n\"From their wheel'd engines torn be every gun\u2014\n\"And now, to sum up every curse in one,\n\"May latent flames, to save us, intervene,\n\"And hell-ward drive them from their magazine!\"\u2014\nThe Frigate now had every sail unfurl'd,\nAnd rush'd tremendous o'er the wat'ry world;\nThus fierce Pelides, eager to destroy,\nChac'd the proud Trojan to the gates of Troy\u2014\nSwift o'er the waves while hostile they pursue\nAs swiftly from their fangs Aurora flew,\nAt length Henlopen's cape we gain'd once more,\nAnd vainly strove to force the ship ashore;\nStern fate forbade the barren shore to gain,\nDenial sad, and source of future pain!\nFor then the inspiring breezes ceas'd to blow,\nLost were they all, and smooth the seas below;\nBy the broad cape becalm'd, our lifeless sails\nNo longer swell'd their bosoms to the gales;\nThe ship, unable to pursue her way,\nTumbling about, at her own guidance lay,\nNo more the helm its wonted influence lends,\nNo oars assist us, and no breeze befriends;\nMeantime the foe, advancing from the sea,\nRang'd her black cannon, pointed on our lee,\nThen up she luff'd, and blaz'd her entrails dire,\nBearing destruction, terror, death and fire.\n  Vext at our fate, we prim'd a piece, and then\nReturn'd the shot, to shew them we were men.\nDull night at length her dusky pinions spread,\nAnd every hope to 'scape the foe was fled;\nClose to thy cape, Henlopen, though we press'd,\nWe could not gain thy desert, dreary breast;\nThough ruin'd trees beshroud thy barren shore\nWith mounds of sand half hid, or cover'd o'er,\nThough ruffian winds disturb thy summit bare,\nYet every hope and every wish was there;\nIn vain we sought to reach the joyless strand,\nFate stood between, and barr'd us from the land.\n  All dead becalm'd, and helpless as we lay,\nThe ebbing current forc'd us back to sea,\nWhile vengeful Iris, thirsting for our blood,\nFlash'd her red lightnings o'er the trembling flood,\nAt every flash a storm of ruin came\n'Till our shock'd vessel shook through all her frame\u2014\nMad for revenge, our breasts with fury glow\nTo wreak returns of vengeance on the foe;\nFull at his hull our pointed guns we rais'd,\nHis hull resounded as the cannon blaz'd;\nThrough his main top-sail one a passage tore,\nHis sides re-echo'd to the dreadful roar,\nAlternate fires dispell'd the shades of night\u2014\nBut how unequal was this daring fight!\nOur stoutest guns threw but a six-pound ball,\nTwelve pounders from the foe our sides did maul,\nAnd, while no power to save him intervenes,\nA bullet struck our captain of Marines;\nFierce, though he bid defiance to the foe\nHe felt his death and ruin in the blow,\nHeadlong he fell, distracted with the wound,\nThe deck distain'd, and heart blood streaming round.\nAnother blast, as fatal in its aim,\nWing'd by destruction, through our rigging came,\nAnd, whistling tunes from hell upon its way,\nShrouds, stays, and braces tore at once away,\nSails, blocks, and oars in scatter'd fragments fly\u2014\nTheir softest language was\u2014submit, or die!\n  Repeated cries throughout the ship resound;\nNow every bullet brought a different wound;\n'Twixt wind and water, one assail'd the side,\nThrough this aperture rush'd the briny tide\u2014\n'Twas then the Master trembled for his crew,\nAnd bade thy shores, O Delaware, adieu!\u2014\nAnd must we yield to yon' destructive ball,\nAnd must our colours to these ruffians fall!\u2014\nThey fall!\u2014his thunders forc'd our pride to bend,\nThe lofty topsails with their yards descend,\nAnd the proud foe, such leagues of ocean pass'd,\nHis wish completed in our woe at last.\n  Convey'd to York, we found, at length, too late,\nThat Death was better than the prisoner's fate;\nThere doom'd to famine, shackles and despair,\nCondemn'd to breathe a foul, infected air\nIn sickly hulks, devoted while we lay,\nSuccessive funerals gloom'd each dismal day\u2014\nBut what on captives British rage can do,\nAnother Canto, friend, shall let you know.\n  The various horrors of these hulks to tell,\nThese Prison Ships where pain and horror dwell,\nWhere death in tenfold vengeance holds his reign,\nAnd injur'd ghosts, yet unaveng'd, complain;\nThis be my task\u2014ungenerous Britons, you\nConspire to murder those you can't subdue.\u2014\n  Weak as I am, I'll try my strength to-day\nAnd my best arrows at these hell-hounds play,\nTo future years one scene of death prolong,\nAnd hang them up to infamy, in song.\n  That Britain's rage should dye our plains with gore,\nAnd desolation spread through every shore,\nNone e'er could doubt, that her ambition knew,\nThis was to rage and disappointment due;\nBut that those monsters whom our soil maintain'd,\nWho first drew breath in this devoted land,\nLike famish'd wolves, should on their country prey,\nAssist its foes, and wrest our lives away,\nThis shocks belief\u2014and bids our soil disown\nSuch friends, subservient to a bankrupt crown,\nBy them the widow mourns her partner dead,\nHer mangled sons to darksome prisons led,\nBy them\u2014and hence my keenest sorrows rise,\nMy friend, my guardian, my Orestes dies;\nStill for that loss must wretched I complain,\nAnd sad Ophelia mourn her favourite swain.\n  Ah! come the day when from this bloody shore\nFate shall remove them to return no more\u2014\nTo scorch'd Bahama shall the traitors go\nWith grief and rage, and unremitting woe,\nOn burning sands to walk their painful round,\nAnd sigh through all the solitary ground,\nWhere no gay flower their haggard eyes shall see,\nAnd find no shade but from the cypress tree.\n  So much we suffer'd from the tribe I hate,\nSo near they shov'd me to the brink of fate,\nWhen two long months in these dark hulks we lay,\nBarr'd down by night, and fainting all the day\nIn the fierce fervours of the solar beam,\nCool'd by no breeze on Hudson's mountain-stream;\nThat not unsung these threescore days shall fall\nTo black oblivion that would cover all!\u2014\n  No masts or sails these crowded ships adorn,\nDismal to view, neglected and forlorn!\nHere, mighty ills oppress the imprison'd throng,\nDull were our slumbers, and our nights too long\u2014\nFrom morn to eve along the decks we lay\nScorch'd into fevers by the solar ray;\nNo friendly awning cast a welcome shade,\nOnce was it promis'd, and was never made;\nNo favours could these sons of death bestow,\n'Twas endless cursing, and continual woe:\nImmortal hatred doth their breasts engage,\nAnd this lost empire swells their souls with rage.\n  Two hulks on Hudson's stormy bosom lie,\nTwo, farther south, affront the pitying eye\u2014\nThere, the black Scorpion at her mooring rides,\nThere, Strombolo swings, yielding to the tides;\nHere, bulky Jersey fills a larger space,\nAnd Hunter, to all hospitals disgrace\u2014\nThou, Scorpion, fatal to thy crowded throng,\nDire theme of horror and Plutonian song,\nRequir'st my lay\u2014thy sultry decks I know,\nAnd all the torments that exist below!\nThe briny wave that Hudson's bosom fills\nDrain'd through her bottom in a thousand rills,\nRotten and old, replete with sighs and groans,\nScarce on the waters she sustain'd her bones;\nHere, doom'd to toil, or founder in the tide,\nAt the moist pumps incessantly we ply'd,\nHere, doom'd to starve, like famish'd dogs we tore\nThe scant allowance, that our tyrants bore.\n  Remembrance shudders at this scene of fears\u2014\nStill in my view some English brute appears,\nSome base-born Hessian slave walks threat'ning by,\nSome servile Scot with murder in his eye\nStill haunts my sight, as vainly they bemoan\nRebellions manag'd so unlike their own!\nO may I never feel the poignant pain\nTo live subjected to such fiends again,\nStewards and Mates that hostile Britain bore,\nCut from the gallows on their native shore;\nTheir ghastly looks and vengeance-beaming eyes\nStill to my view in dismal colours rise\u2014\nO may I ne'er review these dire abodes,\nThese piles for slaughter, floating on the floods,\u2014\nAnd you, that o'er the troubled ocean go,\nStrike not your standards to this miscreant foe,\nBetter the greedy wave should swallow all,\nBetter to meet the death-conducted ball,\nBetter to sleep on ocean's deepest bed,\nAt once destroy'd and number'd with the dead,\nThan thus to perish in the face of day\nWhere twice ten thousand deaths one death delay.\n  When to the ocean dives the western sun,\nAnd the scorch'd Tories fire their evening gun,\n\"Down, rebels, down!\" the angry Scotchmen cry,\n\"Damn'd dogs, descend, or by our broad swords die!\"\n  Hail, dark abode! what can with thee compare\u2014\nHeat, sickness, famine, death, and stagnant air\u2014\nPandora's box, from whence all mischief flew,\nHere real found, torments mankind anew!\u2014\nSwift from the guarded decks we rush'd along,\nAnd vainly sought repose, so vast our throng:\nThree hundred wretches here, denied all light,\nIn crowded mansions pass the infernal night,\nSome for a bed their tatter'd vestments join,\nAnd some on chests, and some on floors recline;\nShut from the blessings of the evening air,\nPensive we lay with mingled corpses there,\nMeagre and wan, and scorch'd with heat below,\nWe loom'd like ghosts, ere death had made us so\u2014\nHow could we else, where heat and hunger join'd\nThus to debase the body and the mind,\nWhere cruel thirst the parching throat invades,\nDries up the man, and fits him for the shades.\n  No waters laded from the bubbling spring\nTo these dire ships the British monsters bring\u2014\nBy planks and ponderous beams completely wall'd\nIn vain for water, and in vain, I call'd\u2014\nNo drop was granted to the midnight prayer,\nTo Dives in these regions of despair!\u2014\nThe loathsome cask a deadly dose contains,\nIts poison circling through the languid veins;\n\"Here, generous Britain, generous, as you say,\n\"To my parch'd tongue one cooling drop convey,\n\"Hell has no mischief like a thirsty throat,\n\"Nor one tormentor like your David Sproat.\"\nDull flew the hours, till, from the East display'd,\nSweet morn dispells the horrors of the shade;\nOn every side dire objects meet the sight,\nAnd pallid forms, and murders of the night,\nThe dead were past their pain, the living groan,\nNor dare to hope another morn their own;\nBut what to them is morn's delightful ray,\nSad and distressful as the close of day,\nO'er distant streams appears the dewy green,\nAnd leafy trees on mountain tops are seen,\nBut they no groves nor grassy mountains tread,\nMark'd for a longer journey to the dead.\n  Black as the clouds that shade St. Kilda's shore,\nWild as the winds that round her mountains roar,\nAt every post some surly vagrant stands,\nPick'd from the British or the Irish bands,\nSome slave from Hesse, some hangman's son at least\nSold and transported, like his brother beast\u2014\nSome miscreant Tory, puff'd with upstart pride,\nLed on by hell to take the royal side;\nDispensing death triumphantly they stand,\nTheir musquets ready to obey command;\nWounds are their sport, as ruin is their aim;\nOn their dark souls compassion has no claim,\nAnd discord only can their spirits please:\nSuch were our tyrants here, and such were these.\n  Ingratitude! no curse like thee is found\nThroughout this jarring world's extended round,\nTheir hearts with malice to our country swell\nBecause in former days we us'd them well!\u2014\nThis pierces deep, too deeply wounds the breast;\nWe help'd them naked, friendless, and distrest,\nReceiv'd their vagrants with an open hand,\nBestow'd them buildings, privilege, and land\u2014\nBehold the change!\u2014when angry Britain rose,\nThese thankless tribes became our fiercest foes,\nBy them devoted, plunder'd, and accurst,\nStung by the serpents whom ourselves had nurs'd.\n  But such a train of endless woes abound,\nSo many mischiefs in these hulks are found,\nThat on them all a poem to prolong\nWould swell too high the horrors of my song\u2014\nHunger and thirst to work our woe combine,\nAnd mouldy bread, and flesh of rotten swine,\nThe mangled carcase, and the batter'd brain,\nThe doctor's poison, and the captain's cane,\nThe soldier's musquet, and the steward's debt,\nThe evening shackle, and the noon-day threat.\n  That juice destructive to the pangs of care\nWhich Rome of old, nor Athens could prepare,\nWhich gains the day for many a modern chief\nWhen cool reflection yields a faint relief,\nThat charm, whose virtue warms the world beside,\nWas by these tyrants to our use denied,\nWhile yet they deign'd that healthy juice to lade\nThe putrid water felt its powerful aid;\nBut when refus'd\u2014to aggravate our pains\u2014\nThen fevers rag'd and revel'd through our veins;\nThroughout my frame I felt its deadly heat,\nI felt my pulse with quicker motions beat:\nA pallid hue o'er every face was spread,\nUnusual pains attack'd the fainting head,\nNo physic here, no doctor to assist,\nMy name was enter'd on the sick man's list;\nTwelve wretches more the same dark symptoms took,\nAnd these were enter'd on the doctor's book;\nThe loathsome Hunter was our destin'd place,\nThe Hunter, to all hospitals disgrace;\nWith soldiers sent to guard us on our road,\nJoyful we left the Scorpion's dire abode;\nSome tears we shed for the remaining crew,\nThen curs'd the hulk, and from her sides withdrew.\n  Now tow'rd the Hunter's gloomy sides we came,\nA slaughter-house, yet hospital in name;\nFor none came there (to pass through all degrees)\n'Till half consum'd, and dying with disease;\u2014\nBut when too near with labouring oars we ply'd,\nThe Mate with curses drove us from the side;\nThat wretch who, banish'd from the navy crew,\nGrown old in blood, did here his trade renew;\nHis serpent's tongue, when on his charge let loose,\nUtter'd reproaches, scandal, and abuse,\nGave all to hell who dar'd his king disown,\nAnd swore mankind were made for George alone:\nTen thousand times, to irritate our woe,\nHe wish'd us founder'd in the gulph below;\nTen thousand times he brandish'd high his stick,\nAnd swore as often that we were not sick\u2014\nAnd yet so pale!\u2014that we were thought by some\nA freight of ghosts from Death's dominions come\u2014\nBut calm'd at length\u2014for who can always rage,\nOr the fierce war of endless passion wage,\nHe pointed to the stairs that led below\nTo damps, disease, and varied shapes of woe\u2014\nDown to the gloom I took my pensive way,\nAlong the decks the dying captives lay;\nSome struck with madness, some with scurvy pain'd,\nBut still of putrid fevers most complain'd!\nOn the hard floors these wasted objects laid,\nThere toss'd and tumbled in the dismal shade,\nThere no soft voice their bitter fate bemoan'd,\nAnd Death strode stately, while the victims groan'd;\nOf leaky decks I heard them long complain,\nDrown'd as they were in deluges of rain,\nDeny'd the comforts of a dying bed,\nAnd not a pillow to support the head\u2014\nHow could they else but pine, and grieve, and sigh,\nDetest a wretched life\u2014and wish to die?\n  Scarce had I mingled with this dismal band\nWhen a thin spectre seiz'd me by the hand\u2014\n\"And art thou come, (death heavy on his eyes)\n\"And art thou come to these abodes,\" he cries;\n\"Why didst thou leave the Scorpion's dark retreat,\n\"And hither haste a surer death to meet?\n\"Why didst thou leave thy damp infected cell?\n\"If that was purgatory, this is hell\u2014\n\"We, too, grown weary of that horrid shade,\n\"Petitioned early for the doctor's aid;\n\"His aid denied, more deadly symptoms came,\n\"Weak, and yet weaker, glow'd the vital flame;\n\"And when disease had worn us down so low\n\"That few could tell if we were ghosts or no,\n\"And all asserted, death would be our fate\u2014\n\"Then to the doctor we were sent\u2014too late.\n\"Here wastes away Autolycus the brave,\n\"Here young Orestes finds a wat'ry grave,\n\"Here gay Alcander, gay, alas! no more,\n\"Dies far sequester'd from his native shore;\n\"He late, perhaps, too eager for the fray,\n\"Chac'd the vile Briton o'er the wat'ry way\n\"'Till fortune jealous, bade her clouds appear,\n\"Turn'd hostile to his fame, and brought him here.\n  \"Thus do our warriors, thus our heroes fall,\n\"Imprison'd here, base ruin meets them all,\n\"Or, sent afar to Britain's barbarous shore,\n\"There die neglected, and return no more:\n\"Ah! rest in peace, poor, injur'd, parted shade,\n\"By cruel hands in death's dark weeds array'd,\n\"But happier climes, where suns unclouded shine,\n\"Light undisturb'd, and endless peace are thine.\"\u2014\n  From Brookland groves a Hessian doctor came,\nNot great his skill, nor greater much his fame;\nFair Science never call'd the wretch her son,\nAnd Art disdain'd the stupid man to own;\u2014\nCan you admire that Science was so coy,\nOr Art refus'd his genius to employ!\u2014\nDo men with brutes an equal dullness share,\nOr cuts yon' grovelling mole the midway air?\nIn polar worlds can Eden's blossoms blow?\nDo trees of God in barren desarts grow?\nAre loaded vines to Etna's summit known,\nOr swells the peach beneath the torrid zone?\u2014\nYet still he doom'd his genius to the rack,\nAnd, as you may suppose, was own'd a quack.\n  He on his charge the healing work begun\nWith antimonial mixtures, by the tun,\nTen minutes was the time he deign'd to stay,\nThe time of grace allotted once a day\u2014\nHe drencht us well with bitter draughts, 'tis true,\nNostrums from hell, and cortex from Peru\u2014\nSome with his pills he sent to Pluto's reign,\nAnd some he blister'd with his flies of Spain;\nHis cream of Tartar walk'd its deadly round,\nTill the lean patient at the potion frown'd,\nAnd swore that hemlock, death, or what you will,\nWere nonsense to the drugs that stuff'd his bill.\u2014\nOn those refusing he bestow'd a kick,\nOr menac'd vengeance with his walking stick;\nHere uncontroul'd he exercis'd his trade,\nAnd grew experienced by the deaths he made;\nBy frequent blows we from his cane endur'd\nHe kill'd at least as many as he cur'd;\nOn our lost comrades built his future fame,\nAnd scatter'd fate, where'er his footsteps came.\n  Some did not seem obedient to his will,\nAnd swore he mingled poison with his pill,\nBut I acquit him by a fair confession,\nHe was no Englishman\u2014he was a Hessian,\u2014\nAlthough a dunce, he had some sense of sin,\nOr else the Lord knows where we now had been;\nPerhaps in that far country sent to range\nWhere never prisoner meets with an exchange\u2014\nThen had we all been banish'd out of time\nNor I return'd to plague the world with rhyme.\n  Fool though he was, yet candour must confess\nNot chief Physician was this dog of Hesse\u2014\nOne master o'er the murdering tribe was plac'd,\nBy him the rest were honour'd or disgrac'd;\u2014\nOnce, and but once, by some strange fortune led\nHe came to see the dying and the dead\u2014\nHe came\u2014but anger so deform'd his eye,\nAnd such a faulchion glitter'd on his thigh,\nAnd such a gloom his visage darken'd o'er,\nAnd two such pistols in his hands he bore!\nThat, by the gods!\u2014with such a load of steel\nHe came, we thought, to murder, not to heal\u2014\nHell in his heart, and mischief in his head,\nHe gloom'd destruction, and had smote us dead,\nHad he so dar'd\u2014but fate with-held his hand\u2014\nHe came\u2014blasphem'd\u2014and turn'd again to land.\n  From this poor vessel, and her sickly crew\nAn English ruffian all his titles drew,\nCaptain, esquire, commander, too, in chief,\nAnd hence he gain'd his bread, and hence his beef,\nBut, sir, you might have search'd creation round\nEre such another miscreant could be found\u2014\nThough unprovok'd, an angry face he bore,\nWe stood astonish'd at the oaths he swore;\nHe swore, till every prisoner stood aghast,\nAnd thought him Satan in a brimstone blast;\nHe wish'd us banish'd from the public light,\nHe wish'd us shrouded in perpetual night!\nThat were he king, no mercy would he show,\nBut drive all rebels to the world below;\nThat if we scoundrels did not scrub the decks\nHis staff should break our damn'd rebellious necks;\nHe swore, besides, that if the ship took fire\nWe too should in the pitchy flame expire;\nAnd meant it so\u2014this tyrant, I engage,\nHad lost his breath to gratify his rage.\u2014\n  If where he walk'd a captive carcase lay,\nStill dreadful was the language of the day\u2014\nHe call'd us dogs, and would have us'd us so,\nBut vengeance check'd the meditated blow,\nThe vengeance from our injur'd nation due\nTo him, and all the base, unmanly crew.\n  Such food they sent, to make complete our woes,\nIt look'd like carrion torn from hungry crows,\nSuch vermin vile on every joint were seen,\nSo black, corrupted, mortified, and lean\nThat once we try'd to move our flinty chief,\nAnd thus address'd him, holding up the beef:\n  \"See, captain, see! what rotten bones we pick,\n\"What kills the healthy cannot cure the sick:\n\"Not dogs on such by Christian men are fed,\n\"And see, good master, see, what lousy bread!\"\n  \"Your meat or bread (this man of flint replied)\n\"Is not my care to manage or provide\u2014\n\"But this, damn'd rebel dogs, I'd have you know,\n\"That better than you merit we bestow;\n\"Out of my sight!\"\u2014\u2014nor more he deign'd to say,\nBut whisk'd about, and frowning, strode away.\n  Each day, at least three carcases we bore,\nAnd scratch'd them graves along the sandy shore;\nBy feeble hands the shallow graves were made,\nNo stone memorial o'er the corpses laid;\nIn barren sands, and far from home, they lie,\nNo friend to shed a tear, when passing by;\nO'er the mean tombs insulting Britons tread,\nSpurn at the sand, and curse the rebel dead.\n  When to your arms these fatal islands fall,\n(For first or last they must be conquer'd all)\n  Americans! to rites sepulchral just,\nWith gentlest footstep press this kindred dust,\nAnd o'er the tombs, if tombs can then be found,\nPlace the green turf, and plant the myrtle round.\nAmericans! a just resentment shew,\nAnd glut revenge on this detested foe;\nWhile the warm blood exults the glowing vein\nStill shall resentment in your bosoms reign,\nCan you forget the greedy Briton's ire,\nYour fields in ruin, and your domes on fire,\nNo age, no sex from lust and murder free,\nAnd, black as night, the hell born refugee!\nMust York forever your best blood entomb,\nAnd these gorg'd monsters triumph in their doom,\nWho leave no art of cruelty untry'd;\nSuch heavy vengeance, and such hellish pride!\nDeath has no charms\u2014his realms dejected lie\nIn the dull climate of a clouded sky;\nDeath has no charms, except in British eyes,\nSee, arm'd for death, the infernal miscreants rise;\nSee how they pant to stain the world with gore,\nAnd millions murder'd, still would murder more;\nThis selfish race, from all the world disjoin'd,\nPerpetual discord spread throughout mankind,\nAim to extend their empire o'er the ball,\nSubject, destroy, absorb, and conquer all,\nAs if the power that form'd us did condemn\nAll other nations to be slaves to them\u2014\nRouse from your sleep, and crush the thievish band,\nDefeat, destroy, and sweep them from the land,\nAlly'd like you, what madness to despair,\nAttack the ruffians while they linger there;\nThere Tryon sits, a monster all complete,\nSee Clinton there with vile Knyphausen meet,\nAnd every wretch whom honour should detest\nThere finds a home\u2014and Arnold with the rest.\nAh! traitors, lost to every sense of shame,\nUnjust supporters of a tyrant's claim;\nFoes to the rights of freedom and of men,\nFlush'd with the blood of thousands you have slain,\nTo the just doom the righteous skies decree\nWe leave you, toiling still in cruelty,\nOr on dark plans in future herds to meet,\nPlans form'd in hell, and projects half complete:\nThe years approach that shall to ruin bring\nYour lords, your chiefs, your miscreant of a king,\nWhose murderous acts shall stamp his name accurs'd,\nAnd his last triumphs more than damn the first.\n",

Joy that ne\u2019er was given,\nSave to the pure, and in their purest hour,\nLife, and Life\u2019s effluence, cloud at once and shower,\nJoy, Lady! is the spirit and the power,\nWhich wedding Nature to us gives in dower\n    A new Earth and new Heaven,\nUndreamt of by the sensual and the proud\u2014\nJoy is the sweet voice, Joy the luminous cloud\u2014\n        We in ourselves rejoice!\nAnd thence flows all that charms or ear or sight,\n    All melodies the echoes of that voice,\nAll colors a suffusion from that light.\nThere was a time when, though my path was rough,\n    This joy within me dallied with distress,\nAnd all misfortunes were but as the stuff\n    Whence Fancy made me dreams of happiness:\nFor hope grew round me, like the twining vine,\nAnd fruits, and foliage, not my own, seemed mine.\nBut now afflictions bow me down to earth:\nNor care I that they rob me of my mirth;\n        But oh! each visitation\nSuspends what nature gave me at my birth,\n    My shaping spirit of Imagination.\nFor not to think of what I needs must feel,\n    But to be still and patient, all I can;\nAnd haply by abstruse research to steal\n    From my own nature all the natural man\u2014\n    This was my sole resource, my only plan:\nTill that which suits a part infects the whole,\nAnd now is almost grown the habit of my soul.\nHence, viper thoughts, that coil around my mind,\n        Reality\u2019s dark dream!\nI turn from you, and listen to the wind,\n    Which long has raved unnoticed.

Thou Wind, that rav\u2019st without,\n    Bare crag, or mountain-tairn, or blasted tree,\nOr pine-grove whither woodman never clomb,\nOr lonely house, long held the witches\u2019 home,\n    Methinks were fitter instruments for thee,\nMad Lutanist! who in this month of showers,\nOf dark-brown gardens, and of peeping flowers,\nMak\u2019st Devils\u2019 yule, with worse than wintry song,\nThe blossoms, buds, and timorous leaves among.\n    Thou Actor, perfect in all tragic sounds!\nThou mighty Poet, e\u2019en to frenzy bold!\n        What tell\u2019st thou now about?\n        \u2018Tis of the rushing of an host in rout,\nWith groans, of trampled men, with smarting wounds\u2014\nAt once they groan with pain, and shudder with the cold!\nBut hush! there is a pause of deepest silence!\n    And all that noise, as of a rushing crowd,\nWith groans, and tremulous shudderings\u2014all is over\u2014\n    It tells another tale, with sounds less deep and loud!\n        A tale of less affright,\n        And tempered with delight,\nAs Otway\u2019s self had framed the tender lay\u2014\n        \u2018Tis of a little child\n        Upon a lonesome wild,\nNor far from home, but she hath lost her way:\nAnd now moans low in bitter grief and fear,\nAnd now screams loud, and hopes to make her mother hear.\n\u2018Tis midnight, but small thoughts have I of sleep:\nFull seldom may my friend such vigils keep!\nVisit her, gentle Sleep! with wings of healing,\n    And may this storm be but a mountain-birth,\nMay all the stars hang bright above her dwelling,\n    Silent as though they watched the sleeping Earth!\n        With light heart may she rise,\n        Gay fancy, cheerful eyes,\n    Joy lift her spirit, joy attune her voice;\nTo her may all things live, from pole to pole,\nTheir life the eddying of her living soul!\n    O simple spirit, guided from above,\nDear Lady! friend devoutest of my choice,\nThus mayest thou ever, evermore rejoice.\n",

a sultry morning breaks;\nThe ground-pines wash their rusty green,\nThe maple-tops their crimson tint,\nOn the soft path each track is seen,\nThe girl's foot leaves its neater print.\nThe pebble loosened from the frost\nAsks of the urchin to be tost.\nIn flint and marble beats a heart,\nThe kind Earth takes her children's part,\nThe green lane is the school-boy's friend,\nLow leaves his quarrel apprehend,\nThe fresh ground loves his top and ball,\nThe air rings jocund to his call,\nThe brimming brook invites a leap,\nHe dives the hollow, climbs the steep.\nThe youth sees omens where he goes,\nAnd speaks all languages the rose,\nThe wood-fly mocks with tiny voice\nThe far halloo of human voice;\nThe perfumed berry on the spray\nSmacks of faint memories far away.\nA subtle chain of countless rings\nThe next into the farthest brings,\nAnd, striving to be man, the worm\nMounts through all the spires of form.\n  The caged linnet in the spring\nHearkens for the choral glee,\nWhen his fellows on the wing\nMigrate from the Southern Sea;\nWhen trellised grapes their flowers unmask,\nAnd the new-born tendrils twine,\nThe old wine darkling in the cask\nFeels the bloom on the living vine,\nAnd bursts the hoops at hint of Spring:\nAnd so, perchance, in Adam's race,\nOf Eden's bower some dream-like trace\nSurvived the Flight and swam the Flood,\nAnd wakes the wish in youngest blood\nTo tread the forfeit Paradise,\nAnd feed once more the exile's eyes;\nAnd ever when the happy child\nIn May beholds the blooming wild,\nAnd hears in heaven the bluebird sing,\n'Onward,' he cries, 'your baskets bring,\u2014\nIn the next field is air more mild,\nAnd o'er yon hazy crest is Eden's balmier spring.'\n  Not for a regiment's parade,\nNor evil laws or rulers made,\nBlue Walden rolls its cannonade,\nBut for a lofty sign\nWhich the Zodiac threw,\nThat the bondage-days are told.\nAnd waters free as winds shall flow.\nLo! how all the tribes combine\nTo rout the flying foe.\nSee, every patriot oak-leaf throws\nHis elfin length upon the snows,\nNot idle, since the leaf all day\nDraws to the spot the solar ray,\nEre sunset quarrying inches down,\nAnd halfway to the mosses brown;\nWhile the grass beneath the rime\nHas hints of the propitious time,\nAnd upward pries and perforates\nThrough the cold slab a thousand gates,\nTill green lances peering through\nBend happy in the welkin blue.\n  As we thaw frozen flesh with snow,\nSo Spring will not her time forerun,\nMix polar night with tropic glow,\nNor cloy us with unshaded sun,\nNor wanton skip with bacchic dance,\nBut she has the temperance\nOf the gods, whereof she is one,\u2014\nMasks her treasury of heat\nUnder east winds crossed with sleet.\nPlants and birds and humble creatures\nWell accept her rule austere;\nTitan-born, to hardy natures\nCold is genial and dear.\nAs Southern wrath to Northern right\nIs but straw to anthracite;\nAs in the day of sacrifice,\nWhen heroes piled the pyre,\nThe dismal Massachusetts ice\nBurned more than others' fire,\nSo Spring guards with surface cold\nThe garnered heat of ages old.\nHers to sow the seed of bread,\nThat man and all the kinds be fed;\nAnd, when the sunlight fills the hours,\nDissolves the crust, displays the flowers.\n  Beneath the calm, within the light,\nA hid unruly appetite\nOf swifter life, a surer hope,\nStrains every sense to larger scope,\nImpatient to anticipate\nThe halting steps of aged Fate.\nSlow grows the palm, too slow the pearl:\nWhen Nature falters, fain would zeal\nGrasp the felloes of her wheel,\nAnd grasping give the orbs another whirl.\nTurn swiftlier round, O tardy ball!\nAnd sun this frozen side.\nBring hither back the robin's call,\nBring back the tulip's pride.\n  Why chidest thou the tardy Spring?\nThe hardy bunting does not chide;\nThe blackbirds make the maples ring\nWith social cheer and jubilee;\nThe redwing flutes his o-ka-lee,\nThe robins know the melting snow;\nThe sparrow meek, prophetic-eyed,\nHer nest beside the snow-drift weaves,\nSecure the osier yet will hide\nHer callow brood in mantling leaves,\u2014\nAnd thou, by science all undone,\nWhy only must thy reason fail\nTo see the southing of the sun?\n  The world rolls round,\u2014mistrust it not,\u2014\nBefalls again what once befell;\nAll things return, both sphere and mote,\nAnd I shall hear my bluebird's note,\nAnd dream the dream of Auburn-dell.\n  April cold with dropping rain\nWillows and lilacs brings again,\nThe whistle of returning birds,\nAnd trumpet-lowing of the herds.\nThe scarlet maple-keys betray\nWhat potent blood hath modest May,\nWhat fiery force the earth renews,\nThe wealth of forms, the flush of hues;\nWhat joy in rosy waves outpoured\nFlows from the heart of Love, the Lord.\n  Hither rolls the storm of heat;\nI feel its finer billows beat\nLike a sea which me infolds;\nHeat with viewless fingers moulds,\nSwells, and mellows, and matures,\nPaints, and flavors, and allures,\nBird and brier inly warms,\nStill enriches and transforms,\nGives the reed and lily length,\nAdds to oak and oxen strength,\nTransforming what it doth infold,\nLife out of death, new out of old,\nPainting fawns' and leopards' fells,\nSeethes the gulf-encrimsoning shells,\nFires gardens with a joyful blaze\nOf tulips, in the morning's rays.\nThe dead log touched bursts into leaf,\nThe wheat-blade whispers of the sheaf.\nWhat god is this imperial Heat,\nEarth's prime secret, sculpture's seat?\nDoth it bear hidden in its heart\nWater-line patterns of all art?\nIs it Daedalus? is it Love?\nOr walks in mask almighty Jove,\nAnd drops from Power's redundant horn\nAll seeds of beauty to be born?\n  Where shall we keep the holiday,\nAnd duly greet the entering May?\nToo strait and low our cottage doors,\nAnd all unmeet our carpet floors;\nNor spacious court, nor monarch's hall,\nSuffice to hold the festival.\nUp and away! where haughty woods\nFront the liberated floods:\nWe will climb the broad-backed hills,\nHear the uproar of their joy;\nWe will mark the leaps and gleams\nOf the new-delivered streams,\nAnd the murmuring rivers of sap\nMount in the pipes of the trees,\nGiddy with day, to the topmost spire,\nWhich for a spike of tender green\nBartered its powdery cap;\nAnd the colors of joy in the bird,\nAnd the love in its carol heard,\nFrog and lizard in holiday coats,\nAnd turtle brave in his golden spots;\nWhile cheerful cries of crag and plain\nReply to the thunder of river and main.\n  As poured the flood of the ancient sea\nSpilling over mountain chains,\nBending forests as bends the sedge,\nFaster flowing o'er the plains,\u2014\nA world-wide wave with a foaming edge\nThat rims the running silver sheet,\u2014\nSo pours the deluge of the heat\nBroad northward o'er the land,\nPainting artless paradises,\nDrugging herbs with Syrian spices,\nFanning secret fires which glow\nIn columbine and clover-blow,\nClimbing the northern zones,\nWhere a thousand pallid towns\nLie like cockles by the main,\nOr tented armies on a plain.\nThe million-handed sculptor moulds\nQuaintest bud and blossom folds,\nThe million-handed painter pours\nOpal hues and purple dye;\nAzaleas flush the island floors,\nAnd the tints of heaven reply.\n  Wreaths for the May! for happy Spring\nTo-day shall all her dowry bring,\nThe love of kind, the joy, the grace,\nHymen of element and race,\nKnowing well to celebrate\nWith song and hue and star and state,\nWith tender light and youthful cheer,\nThe spousals of the new-born year.\n  Spring is strong and virtuous,\nBroad-sowing, cheerful, plenteous,\nQuickening underneath the mould\nGrains beyond the price of gold.\nSo deep and large her bounties are,\nThat one broad, long midsummer day\nShall to the planet overpay\nThe ravage of a year of war.\n  Drug the cup, thou butler sweet,\nAnd send the nectar round;\nThe feet that slid so long on sleet\nAre glad to feel the ground.\nFill and saturate each kind\nWith good according to its mind,\nFill each kind and saturate\nWith good agreeing with its fate,\nAnd soft perfection of its plan\u2014\nWillow and violet, maiden and man.\n  The bitter-sweet, the haunting air\nCreepeth, bloweth everywhere;\nIt preys on all, all prey on it.\nBlooms in beauty, thinks in wit,\nStings the strong with enterprise,\nMakes travellers long for Indian skies,\nAnd where it comes this courier fleet\nFans in all hearts expectance sweet,\nAs if to-morrow should redeem\nThe vanished rose of evening's dream.\nBy houses lies a fresher green,\nOn men and maids a ruddier mien,\nAs if Time brought a new relay\nOf shining virgins every May,\nAnd Summer came to ripen maids\nTo a beauty that not fades.\n  I saw the bud-crowned Spring go forth,\nStepping daily onward north\nTo greet staid ancient cavaliers\nFiling single in stately train.\nAnd who, and who are the travellers?\nThey were Night and Day, and Day and Night,\nPilgrims wight with step forthright.\nI saw the Days deformed and low,\nShort and bent by cold and snow;\nThe merry Spring threw wreaths on them,\nFlower-wreaths gay with bud and bell;\nMany a flower and many a gem,\nThey were refreshed by the smell,\nThey shook the snow from hats and shoon,\nThey put their April raiment on;\nAnd those eternal forms,\nUnhurt by a thousand storms,\nShot up to the height of the sky again,\nAnd danced as merrily as young men.\nI saw them mask their awful glance\nSidewise meek in gossamer lids;\nAnd to speak my thought if none forbids\nIt was as if the eternal gods,\nTired of their starry periods,\nHid their majesty in cloth\nWoven of tulips and painted moth.\nOn carpets green the maskers march\nBelow May's well-appointed arch,\nEach star, each god; each grace amain,\nEvery joy and virtue speed,\nMarching duly in her train,\nAnd fainting Nature at her need\nIs made whole again.\n  'Twas the vintage-day of field and wood,\nWhen magic wine for bards is brewed;\nEvery tree and stem and chink\nGushed with syrup to the brink.\nThe air stole into the streets of towns,\nRefreshed the wise, reformed the clowns,\nAnd betrayed the fund of joy\nTo the high-school and medalled boy:\nOn from hall to chamber ran,\nFrom youth to maid, from boy to man,\nTo babes, and to old eyes as well.\n'Once more,' the old man cried, 'ye clouds,\nAiry turrets purple-piled,\nWhich once my infancy beguiled,\nBeguile me with the wonted spell.\nI know ye skilful to convoy\nThe total freight of hope and joy\nInto rude and homely nooks,\nShed mocking lustres on shelf of books,\nOn farmer's byre, on pasture rude,\nAnd stony pathway to the wood.\nI care not if the pomps you show\nBe what they soothfast appear,\nOr if yon realms in sunset glow\nBe bubbles of the atmosphere.\nAnd if it be to you allowed\nTo fool me with a shining cloud,\nSo only new griefs are consoled\nBy new delights, as old by old,\nFrankly I will be your guest,\nCount your change and cheer the best.\nThe world hath overmuch of pain,\u2014\nIf Nature give me joy again,\nOf such deceit I'll not complain.'\n  Ah! well I mind the calendar,\nFaithful through a thousand years,\nOf the painted race of flowers,\nExact to days, exact to hours,\nCounted on the spacious dial\nYon broidered zodiac girds.\nI know the trusty almanac\nOf the punctual coming-back,\nOn their due days, of the birds.\nI marked them yestermorn,\nA flock of finches darting\nBeneath the crystal arch,\nPiping, as they flew, a march,\u2014\nBelike the one they used in parting\nLast year from yon oak or larch;\nDusky sparrows in a crowd,\nDiving, darting northward free,\nSuddenly betook them all,\nEvery one to his hole in the wall,\nOr to his niche in the apple-tree.\nI greet with joy the choral trains\nFresh from palms and Cuba's canes.\nBest gems of Nature's cabinet,\nWith dews of tropic morning wet,\nBeloved of children, bards and Spring,\nO birds, your perfect virtues bring,\nYour song, your forms, your rhythmic flight,\nYour manners for the heart's delight,\nNestle in hedge, or barn, or roof,\nHere weave your chamber weather-proof,\nForgive our harms, and condescend\nTo man, as to a lubber friend,\nAnd, generous, teach his awkward race\nCourage and probity and grace!\n  Poets praise that hidden wine\nHid in milk we drew\nAt the barrier of Time,\nWhen our life was new.\nWe had eaten fairy fruit,\nWe were quick from head to foot,\nAll the forms we looked on shone\nAs with diamond dews thereon.\nWhat cared we for costly joys,\nThe Museum's far-fetched toys?\nGleam of sunshine on the wall\nPoured a deeper cheer than all\nThe revels of the Carnival.\nWe a pine-grove did prefer\nTo a marble theatre,\nCould with gods on mallows dine,\nNor cared for spices or for wine.\nWreaths of mist and rainbow spanned.\nArch on arch, the grimmest land;\nWhittle of a woodland bird\nMade the pulses dance,\nNote of horn in valleys heard\nFilled the region with romance.\n  None can tell how sweet,\nHow virtuous, the morning air;\nEvery accent vibrates well;\nNot alone the wood-bird's call,\nOr shouting boys that chase their ball,\nPass the height of minstrel skill,\nBut the ploughman's thoughtless cry,\nLowing oxen, sheep that bleat,\nAnd the joiner's hammer-beat,\nSoftened are above their will,\nTake tones from groves they wandered through\nOr flutes which passing angels blew.\nAll grating discords melt,\nNo dissonant note is dealt,\nAnd though thy voice be shrill\nLike rasping file on steel,\nSuch is the temper of the air,\nEcho waits with art and care,\nAnd will the faults of song repair.\n  So by remote Superior Lake,\nAnd by resounding Mackinac,\nWhen northern storms the forest shake,\nAnd billows on the long beach break,\nThe artful Air will separate\nNote by note all sounds that grate,\nSmothering in her ample breast\nAll but godlike words,\nReporting to the happy ear\nOnly purified accords.\nStrangely wrought from barking waves,\nSoft music daunts the Indian braves,\u2014\nConvent-chanting which the child\nHears pealing from the panther's cave\nAnd the impenetrable wild.\n  Soft on the South-wind sleeps the haze:\nSo on thy broad mystic van\nLie the opal-colored days,\nAnd waft the miracle to man.\nSoothsayer of the eldest gods,\nRepairer of what harms betide,\nRevealer of the inmost powers\nPrometheus proffered, Jove denied;\nDisclosing treasures more than true,\nOr in what far to-morrow due;\nSpeaking by the tongues of flowers,\nBy the ten-tongued laurel speaking,\nSinging by the oriole songs,\nHeart of bird the man's heart seeking;\nWhispering hints of treasure hid\nUnder Morn's unlifted lid,\nIslands looming just beyond\nThe dim horizon's utmost bound;\u2014\nWho can, like thee, our rags upbraid,\nOr taunt us with our hope decayed?\nOr who like thee persuade,\nMaking the splendor of the air,\nThe morn and sparkling dew, a snare?\nOr who resent\nThy genius, wiles and blandishment?\n  There is no orator prevails\nTo beckon or persuade\nLike thee the youth or maid:\nThy birds, thy songs, thy brooks, thy gales,\nThy blooms, thy kinds,\nThy echoes in the wilderness,\nSoothe pain, and age, and love's distress,\nFire fainting will, and build heroic minds.\n  For thou, O Spring! canst renovate\nAll that high God did first create.\nBe still his arm and architect,\nRebuild the ruin, mend defect;\nChemist to vamp old worlds with new,\nCoat sea and sky with heavenlier blue,\nNew tint the plumage of the birds,\nAnd slough decay from grazing herds,\nSweep ruins from the scarped mountain,\nCleanse the torrent at the fountain,\nPurge alpine air by towns defiled,\nBring to fair mother fairer child,\nNot less renew the heart and brain,\nScatter the sloth, wash out the stain,\nMake the aged eye sun-clear,\nTo parting soul bring grandeur near.\nUnder gentle types, my Spring\nMasks the might of Nature's king,\nAn energy that searches thorough\nFrom Chaos to the dawning morrow;\nInto all our human plight,\nThe soul's pilgrimage and flight;\nIn city or in solitude,\nStep by step, lifts bad to good,\nWithout halting, without rest,\nLifting Better up to Best;\nPlanting seeds of knowledge pure,\nThrough earth to ripen, through heaven endure.\n",

  "text": "The secret Joys of sweet Coition find:\nNot only Man\u2019s Imperial Race; but they\nThat wing the liquid Air, or swim the Sea,\nOr haunt the Desert, rush into the flame:\nFor Love is Lord of all; and is in all the same.\n\u2019Tis with this rage, the Mother Lion stung,\nScours o\u2019re the Plain; regardless of her young:\nDemanding Rites of Love, she sternly stalks;\nAnd hunts her Lover in his lonely Walks.\n\u2019Tis then the shapeless Bear his Den forsakes;\nIn Woods and Fields a wild destruction makes.\nBoars whet their Tusks; to battle Tygers move;\nEnrag\u2019d with hunger, more enrag\u2019d with love.\nThen wo to him, that in the desert Land\nOf Lybia travels, o\u2019re the burning Sand.\nThe Stallion snuffs the well-known Scent afar;\nAnd snorts and trembles for the distant Mare:\nNor bitts nor Bridles, can his rage restrain;\nAnd rugged Rocks are interpos\u2019d in vain.\nUnruly Torrents, and unfoorded Streams.\nThe bristled Boar, who feels the pleasing wound,\nNew grinds his arming Tusks, and digs the ground.\nThe sleepy Leacher shuts his little Eyes;\nAbout his churning Chaps the frothy bubbles rise:\nHe rubs his sides against a Tree; prepares\nAnd hardens both his Shoulders for the Wars.\n",

  "text": "Shorter and shorter now the twilight clips\n   The days, as though the sunset gates they crowd,\nAnd Summer from her golden collar slips\n   And strays through stubble-fields, and moans aloud,\nSave when by fits the warmer air deceives,\n   And, stealing hopeful to some sheltered bower,\nShe lies on pillows of the yellow leaves,\n   And tries the old tunes over for an hour.\nThe wind, whose tender whisper in the May\n   Set all the young blooms listening through th\u2019 grove,\nSits rustling in the faded boughs to-day\n   And makes his cold and unsuccessful love.\nThe rose has taken off her tire of red\u2014\n   The mullein-stalk its yellow stars have lost,\nAnd the proud meadow-pink hangs down her head\n   Against earth\u2019s chilly bosom, witched with frost.\nThe robin, that was busy all the June,\n   Before the sun had kissed the topmost bough,\nCatching our hearts up in his golden tune,\n   Has given place to the brown cricket now.\nThe very cock crows lonesomely at morn\u2014\n   Each flag and fern the shrinking stream divides\u2014\nUneasy cattle low, and lambs forlorn\n   Creep to their strawy sheds with nettled sides.\nShut up the door: who loves me must not look\n   Upon the withered world, but haste to bring\nHis lighted candle, and his story-book,\n   And live with me the poetry of Spring.\n",

  "text": "(Description of his Village.)\nBeside a stream, that never yet ran dry,\nThere stands a TOWN, not high advanced in fame;\nTho' few its buildings rais'd to please the eye,\nStill this proud title it may fairly claim;\nA Tavern (its first requisite) is there,\nA mill, a black-smith's shop, a place of prayer.\nNay, more\u2014a little market-house is seen\nAnd iron hooks, where beef was never hung,\nNor pork, nor bacon, poultry fat or lean,\nPig's head, or sausage link, or bullock's tongue.\nLook when you will, you see the vacant bench\nNo butcher seated there, no country wench.\nGreat aims were his, who first contriv'd this town;\nA market he would have\u2014but, humbled now,\nSighing, we see its fabric mouldering down,\nThat only serves, at night, to pen the cow:\nAnd hence, by way of jest, it may be said\nThat beef is there, tho' never beef that's dead.\nAbreast the inn\u2014a tree before the door,\nA Printing-Office lifts its humble head\nWhere busy Type old journals doth explore\nFor news that is thro' all the village read;\nWho, year from year, (so cruel is his lot)\nIs author, pressman, devil\u2014and what not?\nFame says he is an odd and curious wight,\nFond to distraction of this native place;\nIn sense, not very dull nor very bright,\nYet shews some marks of humour in his face,\nOne who can pen an anecdote, complete,\nOr plague the parson with the mackled sheet.\nThree times a week, by nimble geldings drawn\nA stage arrives; but scarcely deigns to stop,\nUnless the driver, far in liquor gone,\nHas made some business for the black-smith-shop;\nThen comes this printer's harvest-time of news,\nWelcome alike from Christians, Turks, or Jews.\nEach passenger he eyes with curious glance,\nAnd, if his phiz be mark'd of courteous kind,\nTo conversation, straight, he makes advance,\nHoping, from thence, some paragraph to find,\nSome odd adventure, something new and rare,\nTo set the town a-gape, and make it stare.\nII.\nAll is not Truth ('tis said) that travellers tell \u2014\nSo much the better for this man of news;\nFor hence the country round, that know him well,\nWill, if he prints some lies, his lies excuse.\nEarthquakes, and battles, shipwrecks, myriads slain \u2014\nIf false or true\u2014alike to him are gain.\nBut if this motley tribe say nothing new,\nThen many a lazy, longing look is cast\nTo watch the weary post-boy travelling through,\nOn horse's rump his budget buckled fast;\nWith letters, safe in leathern prison pent,\nAnd, wet from press, full many a packet sent.\nNot Argus with his fifty pair of eyes\nLook'd sharper for his prey than honest TYPE\nExplores each package, of alluring size,\nPrepar'd to seize them with a nimble gripe,\nDid not the post-boy watch his goods, and swear\nThat village TYPE shall only have his share.\nAsk you what matter fills his various page?\nA mere farrago 'tis, of mingled things;\nWhate'er is done on madam TERRA 's stage\nHe to the knowledge of his townsmen brings:\nOne while, he tells of monarchs run away;\nAnd now, of witches drown'd in Buzzard's bay.\nSome miracles he makes, and some he steals;\nHalf Nature's works are giants in his eyes:\nMuch, very much, in wonderment he deals, \u2014\nNew Hampshire apples grown to pumpkin size,\nPumpkins almost as large as country inns,\nAnd ladies bearing, each,\u2014three lovely twins.\nHe, births and deaths with cold indifference views;\nA paragraph from him is all they claim:\nAnd here the rural squire, amongst the news\nSees the fair record of some lordling's fame;\nAll that was good, minutely brought to light,\nAll that was ill,\u2014conceal'd from vulgar sight!\nIII.\nThe Office.\nSource of the wisdom of the country round!\nAgain I turn to that poor lonely shed\nWhere many an author all his fame has found,\nAnd wretched proofs by candle-light are read,\nInverted letters, left the page to grace,\nColons derang'd, and commas out of place.\nBeneath this roof the Muses chose their home; \u2014\nSad was their choice, less bookish ladies say.\nSince from the blessed bour they deign'd to come\nOne single cob-web was not brush'd away: \u2014\nFate early had pronounc'd this building's doom,\nNe'er to be vex'd with boonder, brush, or broom.\nHere, full in view, the ink-bespangled press\nGives to the world its children, with a groan,\nSome born to live a month\u2014a day\u2014some less;\nSome, why they live at all, not clearly known,\nAll that are born must die \u2014TYPE well knows that \u2014\nThe Almanack's his longest-living brat.\nHere lie the types, in curious order rang'd\nReady alike to imprint your prose or verse;\nReady to speak (their order only chang'd)\nCreek-Indian lingo, Dutch, or Highland erse;\nThese types have printed Erskine's Gospel Treat,\nTom Durfey's songs, and Bunyan's works, complete.\nBut faded are their charms\u2014their beauty fled!\nNo more their work your nicer eyes admire;\nHence, from this press no courtly stuff is read;\nBut almanacks, and ballads for the Squire,\nDull paragraphs, in homely language dress'd,\nThe pedlar's bill, and sermons by request.\nHere, doom'd the fortune of the press to try,\nFrom year to year poor TYPE his trade pursues \u2014\nWith anxious care and circumspective eye\nHe dresses out his little sheet of news;\nNow laughing at the world, now looking grave,\nAt once the Muse's midwife\u2014and her slave.\nIn by-past years, perplext with vast designs,\nIn cities fair he strove to gain a seat;\nBut, wandering to a wood of many pines,\nIn solitude he found his best retreat,\nWhen sick of towns, and sorrowful at heart,\nHe to those deserts brought his favorite art.\nIV.\nThou, who art plac'd in some more favour'd spot,\nWhere spires ascend, and ships from every clime\nDischarge their freights\u2014despise not thou the lot\nOf humble TYPE, who here has pass'd his prime;\nAt case and press has labour'd many a day,\nBut now, in years, is verging to decay.\nHe, in his time, the patriot of his town,\nWith press and pen attack'd the royal side,\nDid what he could to pull their Lion down,\nClipp'd at his beard, and twitch'd his sacred hide,\nMimick'd his roarings, trod upon his toes,\nPelted young whelps, and tweak'd the old one's nose.\nRous'd by his page, at church or court-house read,\nFrom depths of woods the willing rustics ran,\nNow by a priest, and now some deacon led\nWith clubs and spits to guard the rights of man;\nLads from the spade, the pick-ax, or the plough\nMarching afar, to fight Burgoyne or Howe.\nWhere are they now?\u2014the Village asks with grief,\nWhat were their toils, their conquests, or their gains? \u2014\nPerhaps, they near some State-House beg relief,\nPerhaps, they sleep on Saratoga's plains;\nDoom'd not to live, their country to reproach\nFor seven-years' pay transferr'd to Mammon's coach.\nYe Guardians of your country and her laws!\nSince to the pen and press so much we owe\nStill bid them favour freedom's sacred cause,\nFrom this pure source, let streams unsullied flow;\nHence, a new order grows on reason's plan,\nAnd turns the fierce barbarian into\u2014man.\nChild of the earth, of rude materials fram'd,\nMan, always found a tyrant or a slave,\nFond to be honour'd, valued, rich, or fam'd\nRoves o'er the earth, and subjugates the wave:\nDespots and kings this restless race may share, \u2014\nBut knowledge only makes them worth your care!\n",

I cannot speak the word!\u201d\nSaid Dollinger the pilot man,\n     Tow\u2019ring above the crew,\n\u201cFear not, but trust in Dollinger,\n     And he will fetch you through.\u201d\n\u201cLow bridge!  low bridge!\u201d all heads went down,\n     The laboring bark sped on;\nA mill we passed, we passed church,\n     Hamlets, and fields of corn;\nAnd all the world came out to see,\n     And chased along the shore\nCrying, \u201cAlas, alas, the sheeted rain,\n     The wind, the tempest\u2019s roar!\nAlas, the gallant ship and crew,\n     Can nothing help them more?\u201d\nAnd from our deck sad eyes looked out\n     Across the stormy scene:\nThe tossing wake of billows aft,\n     The bending forests green,\nThe chickens sheltered under carts\n     In lee of barn the cows,\nThe skurrying swine with straw in mouth,\n     The wild spray from our bows!\n               \u201cShe balances!\n               She wavers!\nNow let her go about!\n     If she misses stays and broaches to,\nWe\u2019re all\"\u2014then with a shout,\n               \u201cHuray!  huray!\n               Avast!  belay!\n               Take in more sail!\n               Lord, what a gale!\nHo, boy, haul taut on the hind mule\u2019s tail!\u201d\n\u201cHo!  lighten ship!  ho!  man the pump!\n     Ho, hostler, heave the lead!\u201d\n\u201cAnd count ye all, both great and small,\n     As numbered with the dead:\nFor mariner for forty year,\n     On Erie, boy and man,\nI never yet saw such a storm,\n     Or one\u2019t with it began!\u201d\nSo overboard a keg of nails\n     And anvils three we threw,\nLikewise four bales of gunny-sacks,\n     Two hundred pounds of glue,\nTwo sacks of corn, four ditto wheat,\n     A box of books, a cow,\nA violin, Lord Byron\u2019s works,\n     A rip-saw and a sow.\nA curve!  a curve!  the dangers grow!\n     \u201cLabbord!\u2014stabbord!\u2014s-t-e-a-d-y!\u2014so!\u2014\nHard-a-port, Dol!\u2014hellum-a-lee!\n     Haw the head mule!\u2014the aft one gee!\nLuff!\u2014bring her to the wind!\u201d\n\u201cA quarter-three!\u2014\u2019tis shoaling fast!\n     Three feet large!\u2014t-h-r-e-e feet!\u2014\nThree feet scant!\u201d I cried in fright\n     \u201cOh, is there no retreat?\u201d\nSaid Dollinger, the pilot man,\n     As on the vessel flew,\n\u201cFear not, but trust in Dollinger,\n     And he will fetch you through.\u201d\nA panic struck the bravest hearts,\n     The boldest cheek turned pale;\nFor plain to all, this shoaling said\nA leak had burst the ditch\u2019s bed!\nAnd, straight as bolt from crossbow sped,\nOur ship swept on, with shoaling lead,\n     Before the fearful gale!\n\u201cSever the tow-line!  Cripple the mules!\u201d\n     Too late!  There comes a shock!\n****\nAnother length, and the fated craft\n     Would have swum in the saving lock!\nThen gathered together the shipwrecked crew\n     And took one last embrace,\nWhile sorrowful tears from despairing eyes\n     Ran down each hopeless face;\nAnd some did think of their little ones\n     Whom they never more might see,\nAnd others of waiting wives at home,\n     And mothers that grieved would be.\nBut of all the children of misery there\n     On that poor sinking frame,\nBut one spake words of hope and faith,\n     And I worshipped as they came:\nSaid Dollinger the pilot man,\u2014\n     (O brave heart, strong and true!)\u2014\n\u201cFear not, but trust in Dollinger,\n     For he will fetch you through.\u201d\nLo!  scarce the words have passed his lips\n     The dauntless prophet say\u2019th,\nWhen every soul about him seeth\n     A wonder crown his faith!\nFor straight a farmer brought a plank,\u2014\n     (Mysteriously inspired)\u2014\nAnd laying it unto the ship,\n     In silent awe retired.\nThen every sufferer stood amazed\n     That pilot man before;\nA moment stood.  Then wondering turned,\n     And speechless walked ashore.\n",

The Americas is a platform, built by the settlers, sheriffs, and miners, for the lynching of the other.\n10.

For courtesy\u2019s sweet sake\nAnd pity\u2019s, one brave heart whose joy is dead,\nSmiles ever, answering words which wake\nBut weariness; hides all its ache,\u2014\nIts hopeless ache, its longing and its dread;\nStrong as a martyr at the stake\nRenouncing self; striving to slake\nThe pangs of thirst on bitter hyssop red\nWith vinegar! O brave, strong heart!\nGod sets all days, all hours apart,\nJoy cometh at his hour appointed.\nAnd seas clasp hands to separate\nThem from each other now. Too late!\nTriumphant Love has leagued the elements\nTo do their will. Hath light a mate\nFor swiftness? Can it overweight\nThe air? Or doth the sun know accidents?\nThe light, the air, the sun, inviolate\nFor them, do constant keep and state\nMessage of their ineffable contents\nAnd raptures, each in each. So great\nTheir bliss of loving, even fate\nIn parting them, hath found no instruments\nWhose bitter pain insatiate\nDoth kill it, or their faith abate\nIn presence of Love\u2019s hourly sacraments.\n",

  "text": "One summer night, walking from our house after dinner, stars make the sky almost white.\nMy awe is like blindness; wonder exchanges for sight.\nStar-by-star comprises a multiplicity like thought, but quiet, too dense for any dark planet between.\nWhile single stars are a feature of the horizon at dusk, caught at the edge of the net of gems.\nTransparence hanging on its outer connectedness casts occurrence as accretion, filling in, of extravagant, euphoric blooming.\nThen, being as spirit and in matter is known, here to there.\nI go home and tell my children to come out and look.\nThe souls of my two children fly up like little birds into branches of the Milky Way,  \nchatting with each other, naming constellations, comparing crystals and fire.\nThey exclaim at similarities between what they see in the sky and on our land.\nSo, by wonder, they strengthen correspondence between sky and home.\nI see his dark shape, moving and shifting against night\u2019s screen of stars.\nMy little girl reaches for his lighted silhouette.\nHuman beings are thought upward and flown through by bright birds.\nWe believe stars are spirits of very high frequency.\nWe feel proud our animals come from stars so dense in meaning close to sacrament.\nWe describe time passing in stories about animals; star movement is named for seasonal migrations of deer, wolf, hummingbird, dolphin, and as animals stars walk among us.\nOur snake Olivia, for example, tells me there\u2019s no conflict between humans and rain, because resource is all around us.\nA coyote loved night, and he loved to gaze at the stars.\n\u201cShe looks like a dancer on tiptoe, stepping around pink star-blossoms surging up after rain.\u201d\nConstellations are experienced emotionally as this play of self through plant and animal symbols and values.\nA dream atmosphere flows; everything represented is sacred; being moves in accord, not of time.\nReturning from the Milky Way, she realized crystals had fallen from her bag and looked up.\nMy story links a journey to sky with the creation of stars, in which place accommodates becoming.\nChama River flows north-south to the horizon, then straight up through the Milky Way, like water moving beneath a riverbed that\u2019s dry.        \nAbiquiu Mountain, El Rito Creek, coyote, snake, rainbow and rain, spider and hummingbird identify equivalent spiritual placements above, so wherever we go, there is company, nurture, from every star in our regard.\nI start up to ask my birds to return home, and find our land continuous with a starry sky mapped as entities who set into motion occurrence, here.\nPlace awaits an imprint from this potential, even though starlight arriving now already happened; what happens is a depth of field, before and after drought, fire, storm disruption.\nI move at high speed, but I\u2019m still standing beside my house in the dark. \nTo go there, I find the place on our mesa that correlates to their tree in the sky and leap up.\nSpace stirs as star trilliums emerge through darkness like humus.\nI ask one blossom to please in the future renew these bonds between sky and my children, so they will always hold light in the minerals of their eyes.\nSun on its nightly underground journey weaves a black thread between white days on the cosmic loom, cord or resonance between new experience and meaning.\nThe origin of stars expresses the underlying warp of this fabric; summer solstice draws a diagonal across my floor, precession, weaving ground of informing spirit, so therefore, life is fundamental to stars.\nThe reverse is well known.\nThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t use a telescope, star charts or glasses when I go out; I think of a place; I wait, then fly to my children.\nWhen the star-gate is raised, there\u2019s a narrow door between sky and ground.\nBut when I arrive, I find the sky solid; I can\u2019t break through to visit my starbirds and stand there wondering, before dawn.\nThen sky vault lifts; maybe I can slip through to find the Milky Way and see its blossoms.\nThen our sun appears in the crack and pushes through to the day.\nIt\u2019s so bright, so hot, I step back and cover my eyes; I hear my mother calling.\n",

We need not grieve\nEven for those of them who have not died,\nFor they, made warped and blind by circumstance\nShall live their round from stupid day to day,\nToo dull to know a need; and they shall bear\nDull, blinded folk to rule this world of ours\nWe shall have died from.

  "text": "This evening, as the twilight fell,\nMy younger children watched for me;\nLike cherubs in the window framed,\nI saw the smiling group of three.\nWhile round and round the house I trudged,\nIntent to walk a weary mile, \nOft as I passed within their range,\nThe little things would beck and smile.\nThey watched me, as Astronomers\nWhose business lies in heaven afar,\nAwait, beside the slanting glass,\nThe re-appearance of a star.\nNot so, not so, my pretty ones,\nSeek stars in yonder cloudless sky;\nBut mark no steadfast path for me,\nA comet dire and strange am I. \nNow to the inmost spheres of light\nLifted, my wondering soul dilates,\nNow dropped in endless depth of night,\nMy hope God\u2019s slow recall awaits.\nAmong the shining I have shone,\nAmong the blessing, have been blest,\nThen wearying years have held me bound\nWhere darkness deadness gives, not rest.\nBetween extremes distraught and rent,\nI question not the way I go;\nWho made me, gave it me, I deem,\nThus to aspire, to languish so.\nBut Comets too have holy laws,\nTheir fiery sinews to restrain,\nAnd from their outmost wanderings\nAre drawn to heaven\u2019s dear heart again.\nAnd ye, beloved ones, when ye know\nWhat wild, erratic natures are,\nPray that the laws of heavenly force\nWould hold and guide the Mother star.\n",

I wanted\neverything in the pie and yearned\nall the discarded ingredients.\nI kept myself in the kitchen for years.\nEverything up in smoke and yet my apron\nwas pristine, my hair done just right.\nYou can say it was perfection, a vision\nfrom the past, waving a whisk through a bowl\nas if it were a pitchfork. When I left the house\nmade of confection, that\u2019s when I began to live,\nfor everything I gave up was in that house.\nI remember you there. Your fingerprints vaguely\nvisible in the layer of flour on the table.\n",

Demanded\nto be led out in handcuffs.\nYou won that argument too.\nThe embarrassed young man\nbrought you, you would later say,\nto \u201cthe same dingy little room where ... fugitive slaves\nwere examined and returned to their masters.\u201d\nA grand jury was impaneled.\nYou were delighted, hoping to be imprisoned,\nand twice refused bail.\nNo such luck. Your own attorney bailed you out\nbecause, he said, \u201cI could not see a lady I respected\nput in jail.\u201d The good news was\nthe grand jury, twenty men, indicted you\nfor voting, the charges said,\nbeing then and there, as you well knew,\na person of the female sex,\ncontrary to the statute\nand against the peace\nof the United States of America.\nIn a grey silk dress, white lace collar, and neatly knotted hair,\nyou spent the months before your trial\ngiving speeches the prosecutor feared\nwould persuade every potential juror\nto find you innocent. He needn\u2019t have worried.\nThe Supreme Court had been busy\nnarrowing the 14th Amendment\nto preserve the right to discriminate\non the basis of sex. The judge sustained the objection\nthat you, as a woman, were \u201cnot competent\u201d to testify\nabout your own opinions;\nbarred you from taking the stand;\nread the guilty verdict he\u2019d written\nbefore the trial began.\nHe didn\u2019t let the jurors say a word,\nbut though he kept trying,\nhe couldn\u2019t stop you from declaring\nthat you\u2019d been convicted according to laws\nwritten, interpreted and applied\nby and for the very same men\nwho, not long before, had made it a crime,\n\u201cpunishable with a $1,000 fine\nand six months imprisonment\u201d\nto give a fugitive slave\na swallow of water or crust of bread.\n\u201cAs the slaves who got their freedom,\u201d you said,\n\u201cover, or under, or through\nthe unjust forms of law,\nnow, must women, to get their right\nto a voice in this government, take it.\u201d\nOver every objection, you did.\n    III\nIn Rochester, New York,\nI grew up in the America you insisted had no right\nnot to exist:\nslavery abolished, voting rights\nunabridgeable, at least on paper,\non account of race or sex,\nchild of a card-carrying member\nof your descendants, the League of Women Voters. My mother\nwho thought I was her son\ntaught me nothing\nabout how to be a woman,\nbut she taught me to vote\nand how to drive a stick;\nstood up for herself in supermarkets,\nspoke in a low voice (she\u2019d trained for radio)\nand showed me how to live\nwithout being ashamed\nof being different. A magazine on her nightstand\ntaught me the word for what I am,\nthough it was forty years\nbefore she heard me say it,\na word you never learned,\na word that didn\u2019t exist\nfor a way of being human\nyou probably couldn\u2019t imagine.\nI guess I\u2019m not a truth\nyou\u2019d hold self-evident.\nI wonder if you\u2019d think I was created equal,\nwas created at all, in fact,\nor am just another outrage\nperpetrated by men. I wonder if you\u2019d see me\nrefusing to be abridged\nand tell me, as my mother did,\n\u201cWhatever you look like,\nyou\u2019ll always be my child.\u201d\nNo. You wouldn\u2019t say that.\nYou didn\u2019t have people like me in mind\nwhen you fought your country to redefine\nwhat it means to be a woman,\nbut here we are\nand here I am, abridged, like you, on account of sex, wrapped\nin education, money, and whiteness\nthat have so far kept me from being jailed,\nevicted, beaten, burned or tossed in a ditch\nas my sisters have\nfor defying, like you, statute and form\nand every decree and argument\nthat we are created less,\ncreated to hide, created to cringe, created to accept\nthat we\u2019re excluded, by definition,\nfrom the unabridgeable \u201cWe\u201d\nby whom, for whom,\nAmerica was created.\nAs you said in your suffrage speeches,\nI\u2019m not arguing the question.\nAmerica needed you to refuse\nthe unjust forms\nyou dragged her\nover and under and through.\nWhether or not you see us\nas your daughters,\nAmerica needs us too.\n",

As the years pile up\nour friends become more vocal\nabout their various damages:\nWon\u2019t you let me monetize\nyour affliction, says my friend\nthe corporation.

  "text": "Oh, a hidden power is in my breast, \n    A power that none can fathom; \nI call the tides from seas of rest, \nThey rise, they fall, at my behest; \nAnd many a tardy fisher\u2019s boat, \nI\u2019ve torn apart and set afloat, \n     From out their raging chasm. \nFor I\u2019m an enchantress, old and grave; \n      Concealed I rule the weather; \nOft set I, the lover\u2019s heart a blaze, \nWith hidden power of my fulgent rays, \nOr seek I the souls of dying men, \nAnd call the sea-tides from the fen,\n      And drift them out together. \nI call the rain from the mountain\u2019s peak,\n     And sound the mighty thunder; \nWhen I wax and wane from week to week,\nThe heavens stir, while vain men seek,\nTo solve the myst\u2019ries that I hold, \nBut a bounded portion I unfold, \n     So nations pass and wonder. \nYea, my hidden strength no man may know;\n     Nor myst\u2019ries be expounded;\nI\u2019ll cause the tidal waves to flow, \nAnd I shall wane, and larger grow, \nYet while man rack his shallow brain, \nThe secrets with me still remain, \n      He seeks in vain, confounded. \n",

It was a grackle\nlot; instead of a bumper on a car, there were ten grackles, instead\nof a sunroof, fifty grackles sat high, their bodies shimmers\nunder cheap strip mall lights as shoppers delayed their spending\nto pull out phones and take shots, such spectators we were,\nlike that summer in July, when I was left again\nto wonder who was the child and who the adult,\nthat Sunday evening that hung in the air like bug spray\nwhen my father, the one who fed me and gave me his last name,\nstood two stories on our family porch, every neighbor,\nin all manner of dress, drawn from their homes, in the street watching.\nLet me tell you how he spread his arms wide, like the man\nhe was before Vietnam, or before the schizophrenia.\nLet me tell you how a child learns the alphabet by counting,\nhow she learns only 2 letters separate the words hero and heroin,\nhow he stood high on the ledge of a porch the child never much\nliked because there was a crack in its wooden center as if the world\nwas waiting to open its jaws to swallow her body whole.\nLet me tell you how that July evening didn\u2019t hold death,\nbut instead was the preface to death. The point being he jumped.\nSome will say there are worse songs to sing, others might believe it\na tragedy, but who are we to question the Gods when a man\nunconcerned with the inconvenience of his presence shows up\nin a parking lot winged as an army of himself? Eventually, lights\nwent dark in the shops and each watcher retraced their steps back home\nto find their families, to rejoice over food, to laugh and settle the night;\nand the birds, steadfast they stood, not quite ready for flight\u2014\n",

God bless the day\n      On which we met,\nAnd bless you too, my love, and be with you\nIn sorrow or in happiness, nor let you\n      E'er me forget.\n",

Know too\nwell if Judith was alone, she\u2019d never be able to claw\nher way free. How she and Abra would have to muster\nall their strength to keep him still long enough\nto labor through muscle and bone. Look at the old\nmasters try their best to imagine a woman wielding\na sword. Plaited hair just so. She\u2019s disinterested\nor dainty, no heft or sweat. As if she were serving\ntea\u2014all model and pose. No, my Judith knows\nto roll her sleeves up outside the tent. Clenches\na fistful of hair as anchor for what must be done.\nWatch the blood arc its way to wrist and breast.\nI have thought it all through, you see. The folds\nof flesh gathered at each woman\u2019s wrist, the shadows\non his left arm betraying the sword\u2019s cold hilt.\nTo defeat a man, he must be removed from his body\nby the candlelight he meant as seduction. She\u2019s been\nto his bed before and takes no pleasure in this.\nSome say they know her thoughts by the meat of her\nbrow. Let them think what they want. I have but one job:\nto keep you looking, though I\u2019ve snatched the breath\nfrom your throat. Even the lead white sheets want\nto recoil. Forget the blood, forget poor dead Caravaggio.\nHe only signed one canvas. Lost himself in his own\ncarbon black backdrop. To call my work imperfect\nwould simply be a lie. So I drench my brush in\na palette of bone black\u2014femur and horn transformed\nby their own long burning\u2014and make one last\ninsistence. Between this violence and the sleeping\nenemies outside, my name rises. Some darknesses\nrefuse to fade. \n. I made this\u2014I.\n \n",

We are\nthree strangers in the strangeness of the talk of love,\nand I am a little drunk, returning to my mother,\nwho stacked warm lemons on my neck. Like her, I know\nhow to cut from the wholeness of fruit, how to squeeze\nan open body for its juice, my hand a vise,\nHarlan\u2019s women softening to my fingers: the waxed\npocks of their skins, how women keep their wetness\nunder their bitter whites. In Georgia, we learned to drink\nthe watered sour, heat lightning cracking above\nus, and even new housewives know how to release\nfrom three spoonfuls a pitcher\u2019s worth, how to cut\nthe tart with sugar.

From the phonograph\nof his front seat, Harlan\u2019s voice spins me, the man\nbeside me a coiling leg, and juiced, we say lemons! together\nin the working yeast of this cab, and what unapologetic\nfruit they are, leaving the smell of themselves even\nafter I have scrubbed my hands free from them, my wrists\nhaving pushed men to drink, oh, Sugar, and I want more\nthan anything now to call out for my mother,\nwho could roll into a room with the oval of her uncut\nself, who could press her palm hot against my chest\nas I breathed. We exhale our imbibed sprits out\nto glass, wrapping ourselves in smoke.\nHarlan chews a Nicorette each time he tries to break open\na woman and she serves him only lemons. Night\nis moving us through another coming winter\nand we laugh quietly now to the pressure, each coming\nto the cool center of our single selves, and each pressing\nthe other away from our own opposing bodies, where\nwe are drifting to our separate and yellowed hallways,\nto perfume, the persistence of our missing women.\n",

  "author": "David Tomas Martinez",
  "text": "           Wrenches, screwdrivers, or shovels\nhave never made nice with me. In the shipyard,\nI worked alone, in the dark, deep in\n           the bilges of frigates. For two months,\nI hooked a torch to an oxygen tank with a green line and pulled a red\nhose through bulkheads to gas. The brass tool\n           hissed like an ostrich\nwhen it fed on metal. That day, my flame cut\npermanent deck fittings; the loops fell like bright oranges;\n           I ripened the rusty metal. I knew\nthat this was a job to baby-sit me, a job they gave to bad burners,\nbeginners playing with their tools: who pretended their brass torches\n           were trumpets, and that gulls in the bay were tables\nof distracted diners. When my father was a boy, his father loaded him\nand his siblings in the car and dropped them off downtown\n           so my grandfather could get drunk and my\ngrandmother could pretend he wasn\u2019t drinking again. When I was a boy,\nI enjoyed watching my father dig; with dirt between his palms, he spun\n           the shovel before he dug. As I grew, I tried\nto stay away from work, even when he paid me. I stayed away from him too.\nI never understood how he could work around so much grass. For him,\n           life was work. For him, everything was hard. For me,\nit was not hard. He stalked my mother a long time after their divorce.\nHe never understood she was not sod to be laid, or a sprinkler to be\n           attached to a pvc pipe seven inches in the ground.\nThat pregnant at fifteen was too soon. Neither of us is the most\nmechanical of men, yet we still pride ourselves on how we fashion our tools.\n           I wake up shivering and crying in an empty bed,\n the afternoon light entering and leaving an empty bottle of wine near\nan emptier glass\u2014or roll over and try, and fail, to remember a woman's\n           name, which never really gets old, just uncouth\nto say so, and feel fixed. To feel fixed is to feel a mechanical spirit, to feel love,\nor at least to play at paste for an evening, to make believe she will never leave me,\n           as life almost did when I cut the green hose, and was\nlonely and shaking that day on the deck of the destroyer, looking into the\ngreen water, and wondered what would be written on my tomb:\n           \"Killed by oxygen was this unmechanical man.\"\nIn that moment close to death, I only wanted my own lungs. I didn\u2019t regret\nreturning home and sleeping on my father\u2019s couch. And that summer, I returned\n           to each of the women of my past and bedded\nthem all, trying to reheat our want. I don't regret that\u2013 drinking wine\nand making love, or writing poems and making love, of wanting to stay\n           but nonetheless leaving. I don't regret returning\nwith Said and Spivak, with Weil and Augustine, of telling my father\n\"All sins are an attempt to fill voids,\" or rebuilding my grandfather's\n           house with Hopkins in my head\nas I ripped the tar and shingles off the old roof with a shovel.\nAnd I am not mad for being the second favorite son,\n           Esau turned inside out. Can't regret saying\nthat summer, I was, in fact, already, a bigger and better man\nthan my father because I understood more. I didn't mind he\n           favored my younger brother, who knew less\nthan him. I favored my brother's way of living, of skating\nin the park and smoking weed while I studied and wondered for us all.\n           How ridiculous I was that summer for us all;\nfor not attempting to rebuild any of his love that summer, at all.\n",

  "text": "The only Mexican that ever was Mexican, fought in the revolution\nand drank nightly, and like all machos, crawled into work crudo,\nletting his breath twirl, then clap and sing before sandpaper\njuiced the metal. The only Mexican to never sit in a Catholic pew\nwas born on Halloween, and ate his lunch wrapped in foil against\nthe fence with the other Mexicans. They fixed old Fords where my\ngrandfather worked for years, him and the welder Juan wagered\neach year on who would return first to the Yucatan. Neither did.\nWhen my aunts leave, my dad paces the living room and then rests,\nlike a jaguar who once drank rain off the leaves of Cecropia trees,\nbut now caged, bends his paw on a speaker to watch crowds pass.\nHe asks me to watch grandpa, which means, for the day; in town\nfor two weeks, I have tried my best to avoid this. Many times he will swear,\nand many times grandpa will ask to get in and out of bed, want a sweater,\nhe will ask the time, he will use the toilet, frequently ask for beer,\nabout dinner, when the Padres play, por que no novelas, about bed.\nHe will ask about his house, grandma, to sit outside, he will question\nwhile answering, he will smirk, he will invent languages while tucked in bed.\nHe will bump the table, tap the couch, he will lose his slipper, wedging it in\nthe wheel of his chair, like a small child trapped in a well, everyone will care.\nHe will cry without tears\u2014a broken carburetor of sobs. When I speak\nSpanish, he shakes his head, and reminds me, he is the only Mexican.\n",

For the first time the sun kissed my own naked face and my soul was inflamed with love for the sun, and I wanted my masks no more. And as if in a trance I cried, \u201cBlessed, blessed are the thieves who stole my masks.\u201d\nThus I became a madman.\nAnd I have found both freedom and safety in my madness; the freedom of loneliness and the safety from being understood, for those who understand us enslave something in us.\nBut let me not be too proud of my safety. Even a Thief in a jail is safe from another thief.\n",

  "title": "Green Means Literally a Thousand Things or More",
  "author": "Matt Donovan",
  "text": "So concludes an essay on \u201cFern Hill,\u201d in which the student seems\nsomewhere between jazzed up & pissed off that green might mean\nso many things from one stanza to the next: here, a blooming\nEden proxy; here, rot made by the grip of time. For starters. Or\nthat sun-slaked field, not far from our classroom, as lush-green\nas any Welsh farmyard, greyed overnight with frost. Emerald\nbeer bottle hurled from a car. The slack-jawed lime-green\ngoblin face spanning a front porch post-Halloween\nfor so many weeks it looks like it\u2019s here to stay. The long-ago\nbrown-green of Cleveland, where it rained always & without pity\nupon a past I crave despite myself & our team lost always 14\u20142.\nEvery time we waited in the bleachers for the game to resume,\nmy father would look down upon the outfield\u2019s diagonal lines\n& proclaim Still a lot of green out there, meaning anything\ncan happen & will. Have you ever heard in a crowd the saddest part\nof \u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame,\u201d where everyone lies & pretends\nwe don\u2019t care if we ever get back & makes the last word echo\ntwice more? We always want to get back, whether or not\nwe\u2019re hailing childhood green. Like the student in her essay,\nI too could keep rattling off images of spring & decay\u2014June\nsunset horizon flash, summer hair stained olive from churning\nover-chlorinated pools, green shadow of a hand somewhere\nthat makes it feel as if owls were bearing everything away\u2014\ninstead of looking again at the image online I glimpsed before\nreturning to the still-ungraded hay-high stack of student work. \nMaybe you saw it too? Maybe you also had the spellbound luck\nof wandering to other tasks instead of asking what it means to know\nanything can happen in a wholly different way, instead of looking \nonce more at the slash of police tape that is the only horizon\nthat matters just now for the two men in the photograph who sit\ntogether on the curb, faces glowing blue-red in the lights, both of them\nbleary-eyed but alive, swaddled in aftermath & a blanket that is green,\na detail that couldn\u2019t matter less, given how the numbers of the dead\nstill rise. Here we are again, as inevitable as the clock\u2019s tick, looking in\nat a place that now will never be young. Is there a way to say it\u2014\nThere\u2019s been a shooting\u2014that will allow it to be heard, remembered\n& heard without the easy glide of our past tense? That will stop us\nfrom wanting to turn to anything under the wide starry sky that is not\nthe green fire burning in the minds of those men or the green\nof a blanket America provides & provides without change? \n",

A motorcycle passes, a French police siren\nyou say sounds innocuous then we both laugh sourly.\nI hadn\u2019t seen a woman slap a child in some time.\nA truck reversing, and the alarm that continues for hours one morning.\nPorn on a handheld device, its tinny echo in a room\nwith bare floors and very little furniture.\nAcross the courtyard, this t-shirt on a hanger out the window\nturns in the light breeze as if trying to look behind itself.\nI\u2019m consumed with not knowing where to buy paper, safety pins, stamps.\nThe windowframes of that building are red, emerging from grey gables.\nEnormous bumblebee at the threshold investigates the doorway, doesn\u2019t enter.\nThe flies do; they\u2019re promiscuous; they leave.\nI don\u2019t know the word for because.\nSo each act is disconnected from another.\nI can almost imagine there are no consequences,\nthe days just pass, one sunny, one cloudy, someone unseen shouts, sirens\nevery few hours, clouds move in a solemn procession across\na wide sky staggered with chimneys,\npeople wait to cross the street, a large tree tosses its wig a little.\nOther small trees in the courtyard flicker.\nThey are responsive.\nThe sun heats the pavement; le pav\u00e9 r\u00e9pond.\nYou send me a short erotic video, you\u2019re naked, propositioning me.\nDo you act more like the coin or the water?\nAcross the narrow street this bird\nsipping from roof puddles\nseems more dove than pigeon.\nPacing, grandmotherly, she keeps stopping to look at me.\nDo you just know how to love another person\nlike someone knew to paint those windowframes red?\nMost of the architecture looks floral, like a boring math problem.\nThe crosses that reach and reach.\nWhy does the scrape of the furniture when I rearrange it\nsound like crass American English to me?\nI slept late, now I\u2019m watching the clouds, like clouds\nin an eighteenth-century painting. Overly articulate.\nExcept these clouds are not trying to symbolize anything.\nWhere\u2019s my dove.\nI always want to go look at people.\nA booth selling copies of copies of Louis Vuitton.\nThe small shadow the roof makes on another roof right next to it.\nWhen my friend came to Paris she wanted to break everything.\nImpeccable shoes on the impeccable feet.\nClothes so new they\u2019re creamy, and to seem to never have to compromise.\nI feel tattered when I\u2019m actually not;\nI\u2019m an American, I eat.\nA huge decorative basket of citrus stationed beside me in the upscale bistro.\nThe woman from a building opposite comes down, indignant:\nWho threw a pomelo into my window?\nYou read to me about the history of the barricade.\nI picture the drab suburbs.\nThe shoulders and elbows of people in the museum evoke more reaction\nin me than most of the paintings.\nA young lithe person with live eyes tends bar, gender trouble tattooed up their arm.\nI count twenty-nine sleeping bags lined up beneath the overhang\nand each one inhabited.\nI read to you about the history of enclosure.\nTwo people talking on a balcony, their black hair blowing.\nOne leaning over into the courtyard.\nBehind the cathedral, vulgar black felt stapled in the raised flowerbeds\nto mask their frames.\nThe river stinks, allures, as a specific person can.\nA repository, a consequence, a long sentence, an ongoing story.\nThe generous current cut through by a party boat shouting\nwooo! wooo! wooooooo! wooo!\nemitting an obscene light\nwaving at whatever will wave back\n",

There\u2019s a rat scrambling\nFrom light with fleshy trash in its mouth. A baby strapped\nto its mother\u2019s back, cut loose.\n                                                                       Soldiers crawl the city,\nthe river, the town, the village,\n                                the bedroom, our kitchen. They eat everything.\nOr burn it.\nThey kill what they cannot take. They rape. What they cannot kill\n                                                                                        they take.\nRumors fall like rain.\nswallowed for restless peace.\nLike sunset slanting toward a moonless midnight.\nLike a train blown free of its destination.                      Like a seed\nfallen where\nthere is no chance of trees          or anyplace       for birds to live.\nNo, start here.                    Deer peer from the edge of the woods.\n                                                         We used to see woodpeckers\nThe size of the sun, and were greeted\nWe\u2019d started to cook outside, slippery with dew and laughter,\n                                    ah those smoky sweet sunrises.\nWe tried to pretend war wasn\u2019t going to happen.\nThough they began building their houses all around us\n                                         and demanding more.\nThey started teaching our children their god\u2019s story,\nNo. Not here.\nYou can\u2019t begin here.\nThis is memory shredded because it is impossible to hold with words,\nThese memories were left here with the trees:\nThe torn pocket of your daughter\u2019s hand-sewn dress,\nthe sash, the lace.\nThe baby\u2019s delicately beaded moccasin still connected to the foot,\nA young man\u2019s note of promise to his beloved\u2014\nNo! This is not the best place to begin.\nEveryone was asleep, despite the distant bombs.\n                                        Terror had become the familiar stranger.\nOur beloved twin girls curled up in their nightgowns,\n                                                                 next to their father and me.\nIf we begin here, none of us will make it to the end\nSomeone has to make it out alive, sang a grandfather\nto his grandson, his granddaughter,\nas he blew his most powerful song into the hearts of the children.\nThere it would be hidden from the soldiers,\nWho would take them miles, rivers, mountains\n                                     from the navel cord place of the origin story.\nHe knew one day, far day, the grandchildren would return,\ngenerations later over slick highways, constructed over old trails\nThrough walls of laws meant to hamper or destroy, over stones\nbearing libraries of the winds.\nHe sang us back\nYes, begin here.\n",

We\nMade plans to be professional\u2014and did. And some of us could Sing\nWhen we drove to the edge of the mountains, with a drum. We\nMade sense of our beautiful crazed lives under the starry stars. Sin\nWas invented by the Christians, as was the Devil, we sang. We\nWere the heathens, but needed to be saved from them: Thin\nChance. We knew we were all related in this story, a little Gin\nWill clarify the dark, and make us all feel like dancing. We\nHad something to do with the origins of blues and jazz\nI argued with the music as I filled the jukebox with dimes in June,\nForty years later and we still want justice. We are still America.

In those\nWho have it pure, it is the soul\u2019s repose, \nThe base of character\u2014no mere reserve \nThat springs from pride, or want of mental nerve.\nThe dignity that wealth, or station, breeds, \nOr in the breast on base emotion feeds, \nIs easy weighed, and easy to be sized\u2014A bastard virtue, much to be despised.\nTrue dignity is like a summer tree. \nBeneath whose shade both beast, and bird, and bee,\nWhen by the heated skies oppressed, may come,\nAnd feel, in its magnificence, at home; \nOr rather like a mountain which forgets\nItself in its own greatness, and so lets \nVast armies fuss and fight upon its sides,\nWhile high in clouds its peaceful summit hides,\nAnd from the voiceless crest of glistening snow, \nPours trickling fatness on the fields below;\nRepellant force, that daunts obtrusive wrong,\nAnd woos the timid steps of right along;\nAnd hence a garb which magistrates prepare,\nWhen called to judge, and really seem to wear. \nIn framing character on whate\u2019er plan, \n\u2018Tis always needed to complete the man, \nThe job quite done, and Dignity without, \nIs like an apple pie, the fruit left out. \n",

Let my ears forget\nthe clack and rumble, our tambourining and fireworking\ndistractions, our roar of applause.

No, I only know the sound my own breath makes\nas I wish and blow that perfect globe away;\nI only know the small, satisfactory\npopping of roots when I call it weed and yank it\nfrom the yard.

God\nis the least of it. When I think\nI\u2019m so angry I could hit you\nin the face, you turn yours to me\nwith a look of disbelief. The rats,\nmeanwhile, have turned up the volume.\nTick, tick, says the silver ball\nas their teeth click against it, thirsty\nas ever, thirstier still at night\nwhen the darkness wakes them.\nAnd during the day, when they\u2019re curled\ntogether in their flannel hammock,\nhead to tail, two furry apostrophes\npossessing nothing but each other,\npaws pressed together as if in prayer\u2014\nto what gods do they prostrate\nthemselves then? God of fidelity? God\nof forgiveness? I lied when I said\nI didn\u2019t believe. Who\u2014even me,\nthe coldest of heart\u2014could turn away\nfrom a sea parted, bread that multiplies\nto answer need, water transformed\nto the sweetest wine, the kind\nthat tastes better for each year\nit\u2019s been left in the barrel?\n",

Lately,\nI\u2019m torn between despair and ignorance.\nI\u2019m not a vegetarian, shop plastic,\nuse an air conditioner. Is this what happens\nbefore it all goes fluvial? Do the selfish\ngrow self-conscious by the withering\nbegonias? Lately, I worry every black dress\nwill have to be worn to a funeral.\nNew York a bouillon, eroded filigree.\nAnything but illness, I beg the plagues,\nbut shiny crows or nuclear rain.\nNot a drop in London May through June.\nI bask in the wilt by golden hour light.\nLately, only lately, it is late. Tucking\nour families into the safeties of the past.\nMy children, will they exist by the time\nit\u2019s irreversible? Will they live\nastonished at the thought of ice\nnot pulled from the mouth of a machine?\nWhich parent will be the one to break\nthe myth; the Arctic wasn\u2019t Sisyphus\u2019s\nsnowy hill. Noah\u2019s wife, I am wringing\nmy hands not knowing how to know\nand move forward. Was it you\nwho gathered flowers once the earth\nhad dried? How did you explain the light\nto all the animals?\n",

Sea! Air!\nThis monument of my despair\nBuild I to the All-Good, All-Fair.\nNot for a private good,\nBut I from my beatitude,\nAlbeit scorned as none was scorned,\nAdorn her as was none adorned.\nI make this maiden an ensample\nTo nature through her kingdoms ample,\nWhereby to model newer races,\nStatelier forms, and fairer faces,\nTo carry man to new degrees\nOf power, and of comeliness.\nThese presents be the hostages\nWhich I pawn for my release;\nSee to thyself, O universe!\nThou art better and not worse. \u2014\nAnd the god having given all,\nIs freed forever from his thrall.\n",

I stood\nover him in the hospital bed\nand traced the outline of his body\nunder the gown, the collar and hip bones,\nhis stomach, his penis, and balls,\nnumbered the black stars\nprinted on the cotton and listened\nto him breathe, mouth\nopen, just so, a way\ninto the hive growing in his chest.\nHe didn\u2019t hear, and then, he couldn\u2019t.\nIn those years, I barely spoke to him\nand now not an hour can pass\nI don\u2019t hear him, now that\nwhat he has to say is always\nfinal, always a last word. And\nMi\u0142osz is buried in Krak\u00f3w\nand my father has entered\neternity as ash, and I am\ncertain what doesn\u2019t last\nlasts\u2014Hydrangea quercifolia,\nHypericum densiflorum,\nSolidago rugosa\n",

  "text": "I don\u2019t understand how we walk around the world\nas if there were a single way for each of us, a kind\nof life stamped into us like a childhood injection,\na cure painstakingly released into the blood with every passing year\nlike a poison transmuted into antidote\nagainst any possible disobedience that might\nawaken in the body. But the body isn\u2019t mere\nsubmissive matter, a mouth that cleanly swallows\nwhatever it\u2019s fed. It\u2019s a lattice\nof little filaments, as I imagine\nthreads of starlight must be. What can never\nbe touched: that\u2019s the body. What lives outside\nthe law when the law is muscled and violent,\na boulder plunging off a precipice\nand crushing everything in its path. How do they manage\nto wander around so happily and comfortably in their bodies, how\ndo they feel so sure, so confident in being what they are: this blood,\nthese organs, this sex, this species? Haven\u2019t they ever longed\nto be a lizard scorching in the sun\nevery day, or an old man, or a vine\nclutching a trunk in search of somewhere\nto hold on, or a boy sprinting till his heart\nbursts from his chest with sheer brute energy,\nwith sheer desire? We\u2019re forced\nto be whatever we resemble. Haven\u2019t\nyou ever wished you knew what it would feel like to have claws\nor roots or fins instead of hands, what it would mean\nif you could only live in silence\nor by murmuring or crying out\nin pain or fear or pleasure? Or if there weren\u2019t any words\nat all and so the soul of every living thing were measured\nby the intensity it manifests\nonce it\u2019s set free?\nYo no s\u00e9 c\u00f3mo se hace para andar por el mundo\ncomo si solo hubiera una posibilidad para cada cual,\nuna manera \nde estar vivos inoculada en las venas durante la ni\u00f1ez,\nun remedio que va liber\u00e1ndose lentamente en la sangre\na lo largo \nde los a\u00f1os igual que un veneno\nque se convierte en un ant\u00eddoto\ncontra cualquier desobediencia que pudiera\ndespertarse en el cuerpo. Pero el cuerpo no es\nuna materia sumisa, una boca que traga limpiamente\naquello con que se la alimenta. Es un entramado\nde peque\u00f1os filamentos, como imagino que son los hilos\nde luz de las estrellas. Lo que nunca podr\u00eda\nser tocado: eso es el cuerpo. Lo que siempre\nqueda afuera \nde la ley cuando la ley es maciza\ny violenta, una piedra descomunal cayendo \ndesde lo alto de una cima\narrasando lo que encuentra. \u00bfC\u00f3mo pueden entonces\nandar tan c\u00f3modos y felices en su cuerpo, c\u00f3mo hacen\npara tener la certeza, la seguridad de que son eso: esa sangre,\nesos \u00f3rganos, ese sexo, esa especie? \u00bfNunca quisieron\nser un lagarto prendido cada d\u00eda del calor del sol\nhasta quemarse el cuero, un hombre viejo, una enredadera\napret\u00e1ndose contra el tronco de un \u00e1rbol para tener de d\u00f3nde\nsostenerse, un chico corriendo hasta que el coraz\u00f3n\nse le sale del pecho de pura energ\u00eda brutal,\nde puro deseo? Nos esforzamos tanto\npor ser aquello a lo que nos parecemos. \u00bfNunca\nse te ocurri\u00f3 c\u00f3mo ser\u00eda si en lugar de manos tuvieras garras\no ra\u00edces o aletas, c\u00f3mo ser\u00eda\nsi la \u00fanica manera de vivir fuera en silencio o aullando\nde placer o de dolor o de miedo,\nsi no hubiera palabras\ny el alma de cada cosa viva se midiera\npor la intensidad de la que es capaz una vez\nque queda suelta? \n",

The governor says he\u2019ll print the names of anyone involved, but it\u2019s okay:\npractically everyone\u2019s on the list. Lately in my bones I can feel tiny protestors slowing the flow of oxygenated blood\u2014this tissue warrants no supply! this tissue warrants no supply!\nNot enough little bubbles are clearing customs, and my eyelids, murderous most recently of spinach, have begun to flutter and twitch.  Beautiful\nday for the Catholics picketing the nearby hospital against abortion, while recent internet searching shows nineteen open cases of child abuse against local clergy.\nI almost succeed in not thinking, \u201cit\u2019s like they want to keep the fetuses alive so the priests can rape them later,\u201d but not quite. I guess this is the everyday horror of thought.\nAt the next table, three engineering students use their big brains to sketch the circuitry of sunglasses that will project holographic movie clips in the air around our heads.\nWe\u2019ll buy scenes like ringtones and illuminate ourselves with Hollywood. I\u2019d buy the guy holding his baby in the rain shouting Good luck exploring the infinite abyss!\nStreet Pulse features reports and opinions on private Mars colonies with an illustration of caravans on a dusty red road exchanging cargo pants for onions. Like anyone, I\u2019m hoping\nwe\u2019ll get behind peace and love before we colonize the solar system, but I\u2019m still noticing people\u2019s bodies more than their sense of responsible citizenship.\nMaybe it\u2019s easier to believe in the enduring virtues of the glute rounding up from the hamstring than the Jeffersonian column in the floodlight at dusk.\nOn cue a jogger passes with PINK on her butt, and here\u2019s a painting of a Dodo in a tilting frame. Google Conquers Death is the title on the next table. Somewhere in Texas\na mad billionaire schemes to start it all up again on a brand new planet, but I\u2019m just bussing my cup and leaving Street Pulse behind. On my way to the bus stop, I wonder\nif a distant descendant will someday hover over this rubble, detect and uncover the digital time capsule hologram we\u2019ve left to run on solar in the ruined rotunda.\nGood luck exploring   \u2014  //  *  Good luck.\n",

  "text": "Quick swim up \nthrough the headlights: gold eye\na startle in black: green swift glance \nraking mine. A full second\nwe held each other, gone. \nGone. And how did I know\nwhat to call it? Lynx, the only possible \nreply though I\u2019d never seen one. The car \nfilling with it: moonlight, \npi\u00f1on: a cat\u2019s acrid smell\nof terror. How quickly the gray body \nfled, swerving to avoid \nmy light. And how often \nthat sight returns to me, shames me \nto know how much more this fragment \nmatters. More than the broad back \nof a man I loved. More than the image\nof my friend, cancer-struck, curled \nby her toilet. More than my regret \nfor the child I did not have which I thought \nonce would pierce me, utterly. Nothing\nbeside that dense muscle, faint gold guard hairs \nstirring the dark. And if I keep \nthese scraps of it, what did it keep of me? \nA flight, a thunder. A shield of light \ndropped before the eyes, pinned \ninside that magnificent skull only time\nwould release. Split back, fade\nand reveal. Wind \nwould open him. Sun would turn him\ncommonplace: a knot of flies, a ribcage\nof shredded tendon, wasp-nest\nfragile. The treasure of him, like anything, \ngone. Even now, I thumb that face\nlike a coin I cannot spend. If something in me \never lived, it lived in him, fishing the cold\ntrout-thick streams, waking to snow, dying\nwhen he died, which is a comfort. \nI must say this. Otherwise, I myself \ndo not exist. It looked at me \na moment. A flash of green, of gold\nand white. Then the dark came down again\nbetween us. Once, I was afraid\nof being changed. Now that is finished. \nThe lynx has me in its eye. \nI am already diminished.\n",

  "text": "The wound on her lip goes white\nbefore returning red.\nThe virus erupts the lines between chin and\nlip, between lip and philtrum.\nA sore across two continents of skin, a\nbridge of lava.\nShe will feel healed when the flesh\ncolor returns. The variation\nis the aberration. Blood courses to\ndeliver a clot. Vessels\nbouquet under the scalp or in the\nwomb, in places where we\nheal fastest. Cells scramble\na lean-to scab, a mortar of new skin.\nThe body wants to draw its\nseams together.\nBut Jesus hangs before the\nconvert eternally\nwounded, eternally weeping\nfrom his gashes.\nHow to open hers without nails or\nthorns? How to measure\nheartbeats without seeing blood\nheave out its rhythms?\nA gush slows under pressure\neven as the pulse\ngoes on. Our lesions take air, our\ninfections seek sunlight. How to\nresist our unwilled mechanisms to\nstaunch?\nWe push through the same tear in the\nworld and leave it sore.\nWhen we come, we come open.\nPick a wound slow to bleed and \nslower to seal. We cream\nthe scar to fade our atlas of living\u2014what\nitched its way to a silver road,\nwhat shadow constellation of pox. The\nconvert counts Jesus\u2019 wounds.\nIf you count both hands and both feet, all\nlashes and piercings\nand the forsaken cry, the number is\nhigher and lower than anyone\u2019s.\n",

  "text": "I ask the new migrant if he regrets leaving Russia.\nWe have dispensed already with my ancestry.\nHe says no. For a time, he was depressed. He found\nwith every return he missed what he left behind.\nA constant state of this. Better to love by far\nwhere you are. He taps the steering wheel of his car,\nthe hum of the engine an imperceptible tremble\nin us. When he isn\u2019t driving, he works tending\nto new trees. I\u2019ve seen these saplings popping\nup all over the suburbs, tickling the bellies\nof bridges, the new rooted darlings of the State.\nThe council spent a quarter mil on them &\nsomeone, he\u2014Lilian\u2014must ensure the dirt\nholds. Gentrification is climate-friendly now.\nI laugh and he laughs, and we eat the distance\nbetween histories. He checks on his buds daily.\nAre they okay? They are okay. They do not need\nhim, but he speaks, and they listen or at least\nshake a leaf. What a world where you can live off\nland by loving it. If only we cared for each other\nthis way. The council cares for their investment.\nThe late greenery, that is, not Lilian, who shares\nhis ride on the side. I wonder what it would cost \nto have men be tender to me regularly, \nto be folded into his burly, to be left on the side\nof the road as he drove away, exhausted. Even\nmy dreams of tenderness involve being used\n& I\u2019m not sure who to blame: colonialism,\ncapitalism, patriarchy, queerness or poetry?\nSorry, this is a commercial for the Kia Sportage\nnow. This is a commercial for Lilian\u2019s thighs.\nHe didn\u2019t ask for this and neither did I\u2014how\nlanguage drapes us together, how stories tongue\neach other in the back seat and the sky blurs\nout of frame. There are too many agonies\nto discuss here, and I am nearly returned.\nHe has taken me all the way back, around\nthe future flowering, back to where I am not,\nto the homes I keep investing in as harms.\nI should fill them with trees. Let the boughs\ncover the remembered boy, cowering\nunder a mother, her raised weapon\nnot the cane but the shattering within,\nlet the green tear through the wall\npaper, let life replace memory. Lilian, I left\nyou that day, and in the leaving, a love\nfollowed. Isn\u2019t that a wonder and a wound?\nTell me which it is, I confess I mistake the two.\nI walk up the stairs to my old brick apartment\nwhere the peach tree reaches for the railing,\na few blushing fruits poking through the bars,\neager to brush my leg, to say linger, halt.\nI want to stop, to hold it for real, just once\nbut I must wait until I am safe.\n",

Conveyor belt of clouds, destroyer \nand preserver of towns, longest breath \nof the earth, tell us what floating means \nto you. Some trees are weeping, river. \nSpeak of all you carry and carry off\nin river song and river silence. Be horse, \nbe ferry, carry us from now to next to. \nRiver, I\u2019m done with fading shadows. \nGive me daylight broken and scattered\nacross your fluid transparent face, \ncome meet me with the moon and the stars \nrunning and tumbling along your sides. \nRiver swinging open like a gate to the sea,\ntime\u2019s no calendar of months, you say,\nbut water in the aftermath of light.  \nYour drifting cargo tells us everything \narrives from far away and long ago \nand ends in the body, boat of heartache \nand ecstasy we pilot, in quest of passage also. \nRiver we call Mississippi or Mekong, \nsing us forth to nowhere but here, \nwith your perfect memory be our flood.\n",

Without such fear\nwho will we be? What will we do without\nthis aching chord, without the bright morning that tore\nthe silver\u2019s towers? Fire and the parched red dirt\nthat binds, the water stolen from our wells,\na black magic dredging the lower rungs of earth.\nWe dream of clover. The soft scent of young lambs\nis the first letter of our alphabet, and the prophets\nwho tighten ropes around their waists to stifle hunger's\npangs, supplicant brows seeking light from earth\u2019s core.\nWhat will we do without the angel\u2019s voice, a tide\nsending us heavenward, a harmattan ushering us into the hell\nof its lows. How can we live without such turbulent hope?\nHow can we accept the certainty of our quiet graves?\nHow can we stop waiting to witness the Lord\u2019s face?\nAnd what will we do without the hardened gaze?\nThe girls walk past, hair fluttering like commas\nbetween poems of musk, a dream of touch like water\ngently falling on smooth, warm stone.\nWhat will we do without the anemones\u2019 mournful dirge\nstroking the dagger\u2019s spine and the gelding\u2019s nightmares.\nOur hatred for our scoured hands, our love of the moment\nwhen the sun drops only for our eyes? Who else will hear\nbirdsong as prayer, who will cleanse himself with the stroke\nof sand? Who keeps the earth rotating with praise\nof your name? And what will this spinning,\nhurtling mean without our voices shouldering it\ntoward some ripe, sweetened pause?\nWhat will you do, dear God, without us? How\nwill you fare, alone again in the empty vast, in the dark\nof your creation, without us giving you your name?\n",

Not point.\nBut it isn\u2019t the point, that it was cold, is it?\nI am blue.\nI am a frozen blue ocean.\nI am a wave struck cold in midair.\nThe wave is nude beneath her blue dress.\nHer skin is blue.\nTo arrive in a place.\nAll water is color. But what does that have to do with you and me, Matthew?\nOur lady of the dressing table.\nOur lady of the rainy day.\nOur lady of palm leaves, periwinkle, calla lilies.\nOur lady of acanthus.\nA garden redone three times.\nEverything then turned a vivid black.\nI do.\nLike a woman, faceless and flung over\na desk, at rest or in tears, exquisite\nquickly drawn ruffles about your shoulder,\nhalos of wide banana leaves\nhovering just above your head?\nWere there images you could not fling\nfrom your mind? Events that clung\nto you, coated you, repeating\nthemselves in a series: movements\nor instruments in a symphony?\nObjects that would not let you go:\nan avocado tree; a certain street\nat night where someone exceptionally kind\nonce took your arm as the two of you walked\nalong a wet sidewalk; trying\nto remember the light on that certain gait:\nyour mother twirling a parasol, also walking\nthrough a grove of olive trees?\nDid you begin to find comfort\nin the serial, the inexplicable and constant\nreappearance of things, people, sensations,\nevery moment symphonically realized\nand reentered. The way the days begin\nwalking into the room again.\nSledge after sledge.\nMatthew?\nOnce I fell through\u2014into the dark.\nBraces and casts.\nBeing told not to write.\nBeing told not to read.\nForgetting someone I once promised I would never forget.\nRemembering her finally, one year, then forgetting her again, the next day.\nRemembering not remembering I\u2019d forgotten.\nForgetting them completely.\nHim, I think. Yes. I could marry him.\nI could slip into his bed.\nWe could talk about real things.\nI could be his dark line hovering above.\nWe could watch the light turning the room every color.\n",

The taste undid my eyes\nAnd led me far from the gardens planted for a child\nTo wildernesses deeper than any master\u2019s call.\nNow these cool hands guide what they once caressed;\nLips forget what they have kissed.\nMy eyes now pool their light\nBetter the summit to see.\nI would do it all over again:\nBe the harbor and set the sail,\nLoose the breeze and harness the gale,\nCherish the harvest of what I have been.\nBetter the summit to scale.\nBetter the summit to be.\n",

There\u2019s the river, \nrivering south, \n                           as rivers tend to. Beside the river, \ntwo men are fucking. Young men. Almost too young \nto even know about fucking, thinks the king, who can\u2019t \nhelp noticing how the men bring a somehow grace\nto the business between them\u2014a grace that some might \nconfuse with love. But the king \n                                                         rarely makes mistakes, \nwhich is to say, he knows mercy when he sees it. What \ndoes mercy have to do with fucking? What does love\nhave to do with grace? What are dreams but the only\nrivers memory knows how to make? There\u2019s a kind of\nmusic \n            to how the men routinely but unpredictably trade \nplaces entering and withdrawing from each other.

Beneath \nthe brocaded cloak, each bead stitched to it by hand, \nbeneath the cloak of some more breathable, lighter fabric \nbeneath that, the king\u2019s cock rests like tenderness itself \nagainst the king\u2019s left thigh.

I write\nTo restore candor to the mind.\nThere are raindrops on the window,\nAnd a peregrine wind gusts on the grass.\nI think of my old red flannel shirt,\nThe one I threw away in July.\nI would like to pat the warm belly of a\nBeagle or the hand of a handsome woman.\nI look ahead to cheese and wine,\nAnd a bit of Bach, perhaps,\nOr Schumann on the bow of Yo-Yo Ma.\nI see the mountains as I saw them\nWhen my heart was young.\nBut were they not a deeper blue,\nshimmering under the fluency of skies\nRadiant with crystal light? Across the way\nThe yellow land lies out, and standing stones\nForm distant islands in the field of time.\nhere is a stillness on this perfect world,\nAnd I am content to settle in its hold.\nI turn inward on a wall of books.\nThey are old friends, even those that\nHave dislodged my dreams. One by one\nThey have shaped the thing I am.\nThese are the days that swarm\nInto the shadows of legend. I ponder.\nAnd when the image on the glass\nIs refracted into the prisms of the past\nI shall remember: my parents speaking\nQuietly in a warm familiar room, and\nI bend to redeem an errant, broken doll.\nMy little daughter, her eyes brimming\nWith love, beholds the ember of my soul.\nThere is the rattle of a teacup, and\nAt the window and among the vines,\nThe whir of a hummingbird\u2019s wings.\nIn the blue evening, in another room,\nThere is the faint laughter of ghosts,\nAnd in a tarnished silver frame, the\nlikeness of a boy who bears my name.\n",

  "title": "The Courtship of Miles Standish",
  "author": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow",
  "text": "In the Old Colony days, in Plymouth the land of the Pilgrims,\nTo and fro in a room of his simple and primitive dwelling,\nClad in doublet and hose, and boots of Cordovan leather,\nStrode, with a martial air, Miles Standish the Puritan Captain.\nBuried in thought he seemed, with his hands behind him, and pausing\nEver and anon to behold his glittering weapons of warfare,\nHanging in shining array along the walls of the chamber,\u2014\nCutlass and corselet of steel, and his trusty sword of Damascus,\nCurved at the point and inscribed with its mystical Arabic sentence,\nWhile underneath, in a corner, were fowling-piece, musket, and matchlock.\nShort of stature he was, but strongly built and athletic,\nBroad in the shoulders, deep-chested, with muscles and sinews of iron;\nBrown as a nut was his face, but his russet beard was already\nFlaked with patches of snow, as hedges sometimes in November.\nNear him was seated John Alden, his friend, and household companion,\nWriting with diligent speed at a table of pine by the window;\nFair-haired, azure-eyed, with delicate Saxon complexion,\nHaving the dew of his youth, and the beauty thereof, as the captives\nWhom Saint Gregory saw, and exclaimed, \"Not Angles, but Angels.\"\nYoungest of all was he of the men who came in the Mayflower.\nSuddenly breaking the silence, the diligent scribe interrupting,\nSpake, in the pride of his heart, Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth.\n\"Look at these arms,\" he said, \"the warlike weapons that hang here\nBurnished and bright and clean, as if for parade or inspection!\nThis is the sword of Damascus I fought with in Flanders; this breastplate,\nWell I remember the day! once saved my life in a skirmish;\nHere in front you can see the very dint of the bullet\nFired point-blank at my heart by a Spanish arcabucero.\nHad it not been of sheer steel, the forgotten bones of Miles Standish\nWould at this moment be mould, in their grave in the Flemish morasses.\"\nThereupon answered John Alden, but looked not up from his writing:\n\"Truly the breath of the Lord hath slackened the speed of the bullet;\nHe in his mercy preserved you, to be our shield and our weapon!\"\nStill the Captain continued, unheeding the words of the stripling:\n\"See, how bright they are burnished, as if in an arsenal hanging;\nThat is because I have done it myself, and not left it to others.\nServe yourself, would you be well served, is an excellent adage;\nSo I take care of my arms, as you of your pens and your inkhorn.\nThen, too, there are my soldiers, my great, invincible army,\nTwelve men, all equipped, having each his rest and his matchlock,\nEighteen shillings a month, together with diet and pillage,\nAnd, like Caesar, I know the name of each of my soldiers!\"\nThis he said with a smile, that danced in his eyes, as the sunbeams\nDance on the waves of the sea, and vanish again in a moment.\nAlden laughed as he wrote, and still the Captain continued:\n\"Look! you can see from this window my brazen howitzer planted\nHigh on the roof of the church, a preacher who speaks to the purpose,\nSteady, straight-forward, and strong, with irresistible logic,\nOrthodox, flashing conviction right into the hearts of the heathen.\nNow we are ready, I think, for any assault of the Indians;\nLet them come, if they like, and the sooner they try it the better,\u2014\nLet them come if they like, be it sagamore, sachem, or pow-wow,\nAspinet, Samoset, Corbitant, Squanto, or Tokamahamon!\"\nLong at the window he stood, and wistfully gazed on the landscape,\nWashed with a cold gray mist, the vapory breath of the east-wind,\nForest and meadow and hill, and the steel-blue rim of the ocean,\nLying silent and sad, in the afternoon shadows and sunshine.\nOver his countenance flitted a shadow like those on the landscape,\nGloom intermingled with light; and his voice was subdued with emotion,\nTenderness, pity, regret, as after a pause he proceeded:\n\"Yonder there, on the hill by the sea, lies buried Rose Standish;\nBeautiful rose of love, that bloomed for me by the wayside!\nShe was the first to die of all who came in the Mayflower!\nGreen above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there,\nBetter to hide from the Indian scouts the graves of our people,\nLest they should count them and see how many already have perished!\"\nSadly his face he averted, and strode up and down, and was thoughtful.\nFixed to the opposite wall was a shelf of books, and among them\nProminent three, distinguished alike for bulk and for binding;\nBariffe's Artillery Guide, and the Commentaries of Caesar,\nOut of the Latin translated by Arthur Goldinge of London,\nAnd, as if guarded by these, between them was standing the Bible.\nMusing a moment before them, Miles Standish paused, as if doubtful\nWhich of the three he should choose for his consolation and comfort,\nWhether the wars of the Hebrews, the famous campaigns of the Romans,\nOr the Artillery practice, designed for belligerent Christians.\nFinally down from its shelf he dragged the ponderous Roman,\nSeated himself at the window, and opened the book, and in silence\nTurned o'er the well-worn leaves, where thumb-marks thick on the margin,\nLike the trample of feet, proclaimed the battle was hottest.\nNothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling,\nBusily writing epistles important, to go by the Mayflower,\nReady to sail on the morrow, or next day at latest, God willing!\nHomeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter,\nLetters written by Alden, and full of the name of Priscilla,\nFull of the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Priscilla!\nNothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling,\nOr an occasional sigh from the laboring heart of the Captain,\nReading the marvellous words and achievements of Julius Caesar.\nAfter a while he exclaimed, as he smote with his hand, palm downwards,\nHeavily on the page: \"A wonderful man was this Caesar!\nYou are a writer, and I am a fighter, but here is a fellow\nWho could both write and fight, and in both was equally skilful!\"\nStraightway answered and spake John Alden, the comely, the youthful:\n\"Yes, he was equally skilled, as you say, with his pen and his weapons.\nSomewhere have I read, but where I forget, he could dictate\nSeven letters at once, at the same time writing his memoirs.\"\n\"Truly,\" continued the Captain, not heeding or hearing the other,\n\"Truly a wonderful man was Caius Julius Caesar!\nBetter be first, he said, in a little Iberian village,\nThan be second in Rome, and I think he was right when he said it.\nTwice was he married before he was twenty, and many times after;\nBattles five hundred he fought, and a thousand cities he conquered;\nHe, too, fought in Flanders, as he himself has recorded;\nFinally he was stabbed by his friend, the orator Brutus!\nNow, do you know what he did on a certain occasion in Flanders,\nWhen the rear-guard of his army retreated, the front giving way too,\nAnd the immortal Twelfth Legion was crowded so closely together\nThere was no room for their swords? Why, he seized a shield from a soldier,\nPut himself straight at the head of his troops, and commanded the captains,\nCalling on each by his name, to order forward the ensigns;\nThen to widen the ranks, and give more room for their weapons;\nSo he won the day, the battle of something-or-other.\nThat's what I always say; if you wish a thing to be well done,\nYou must do it yourself, you must not leave it to others!\"\nAll was silent again; the Captain continued his reading.\nNothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling\nWriting epistles important to go next day by the Mayflower,\nFilled with the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Priscilla;\nEvery sentence began or closed with the name of Priscilla,\nTill the treacherous pen, to which he confided the secret,\nStrove to betray it by singing and shouting the name of Priscilla!\nFinally closing his book, with a bang of the ponderous cover,\nSudden and loud as the sound of a soldier grounding his musket,\nThus to the young man spake Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth:\n\"When you have finished your work, I have something important to tell you.\nBe not however in haste; I can wait; I shall not be impatient!\"\nStraightway Alden replied, as he folded the last of his letters,\nPushing his papers aside, and giving respectful attention:\n\"Speak; for whenever you speak, I am always ready to listen,\nAlways ready to hear whatever pertains to Miles Standish.\"\nThereupon answered the Captain, embarrassed, and culling his phrases:\n\"'T is not good for a man to be alone, say the Scriptures.\nThis I have said before, and again and again I repeat it;\nEvery hour in the day, I think it, and feel it, and say it.\nSince Rose Standish died, my life has been weary and dreary;\nSick at heart have I been, beyond the healing of friendship.\nOft in my lonely hours have I thought of the maiden Priscilla.\nShe is alone in the world; her father and mother and brother\nDied in the winter together; I saw her going and coming,\nNow to the grave of the dead, and now to the bed of the dying,\nPatient, courageous, and strong, and said to myself, that if ever\nThere were angels on earth, as there are angels in heaven,\nTwo have I seen and known; and the angel whose name is Priscilla\nHolds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned.\nLong have I cherished the thought, but never have dared to reveal it,\nBeing a coward in this, though valiant enough for the most part.\nGo to the damsel Priscilla, the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,\nSay that a blunt old Captain, a man not of words but of actions,\nOffers his hand and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier.\nNot in these words, you know, but this in short is my meaning;\nI am a maker of war, and not a maker of phrases.\nYou, who are bred as a scholar, can say it in elegant language,\nSuch as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers,\nSuch as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden.\"\nWhen he had spoken, John Alden, the fair-haired, taciturn stripling,\nAll aghast at his words, surprised, embarrassed, bewildered,\nTrying to mask his dismay by treating the subject with lightness,\nTrying to smile, and yet feeling his heart stand still in his bosom,\nJust as a timepiece stops in a house that is stricken by lightning,\nThus made answer and spake, or rather stammered than answered:\n\"Such a message as that, I am sure I should mangle and mar it;\nIf you would have it well done,--I am only repeating your maxim,\u2014\nYou must do it yourself, you must not leave it to others!\"\nBut with the air of a man whom nothing can turn from his purpose,\nGravely shaking his head, made answer the Captain of Plymouth:\n\"Truly the maxim is good, and I do not mean to gainsay it;\nBut we must use it discreetly, and not waste powder for nothing.\nNow, as I said before, I was never a maker of phrases.\nI can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender,\nBut march up to a woman with such a proposal, I dare not.\nI'm not afraid of bullets, nor shot from the mouth of a cannon,\nBut of a thundering \"No!\" point-blank from the mouth of a woman,\nThat I confess I'm afraid of, nor am I ashamed to confess it!\nSo you must grant my request, for you are an elegant scholar,\nHaving the graces of speech, and skill in the turning of phrases.\"\nTaking the hand of his friend, who still was reluctant and doubtful,\nHolding it long in his own, and pressing it kindly, he added:\n\"Though I have spoken thus lightly, yet deep is the feeling that prompts me;\nSurely you cannot refuse what I ask in the name of our friendship!\"\nThen made answer John Alden: \"The name of friendship is sacred;\nWhat you demand in that name, I have not the power to deny you!\"\nSo the strong will prevailed, subduing and moulding the gentler,\nFriendship prevailed over love, and Alden went on his errand.\nSo the strong will prevailed, and Alden went on his errand,\nOut of the street of the village, and into the paths of the forest,\nInto the tranquil woods, where blue-birds and robins were building\nTowns in the populous trees, with hanging gardens of verdure,\nPeaceful, aerial cities of joy and affection and freedom.\nAll around him was calm, but within him commotion and conflict,\nLove contending with friendship, and self with each generous impulse.\nTo and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing,\nAs in a foundering ship, with every roll of the vessel,\nWashes the bitter sea, the merciless surge of the ocean!\n\"Must I relinquish it all,\" he cried with a wild lamentation,\n\"Must I relinquish it all, the joy, the hope, the illusion?\nWas it for this I have loved, and waited, and worshipped in silence?\nWas it for this I have followed the flying feet and the shadow\nOver the wintry sea, to the desolate shores of New England?\nTruly the heart is deceitful, and out of its depths of corruption\nRise, like an exhalation, the misty phantoms of passion;\nAngels of light they seem, but are only delusions of Satan.\nAll is clear to me now; I feel it, I see it distinctly!\nThis is the hand of the Lord; it is laid upon me in anger,\nFor I have followed too much the heart's desires and devices,\nWorshipping Astaroth blindly, and impious idols of Baal.\nThis is the cross I must bear; the sin and the swift retribution.\"\nSo through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;\nCrossing the brook at the ford, where it brawled over pebble and shallow,\nGathering still, as he went, the May-flowers blooming around him,\nFragrant, filling the air with a strange and wonderful sweetness,\nChildren lost in the woods, and covered with leaves in their slumber.\n\"Puritan flowers,\" he said, \"and the type of Puritan maidens,\nModest and simple and sweet, the very type of Priscilla!\nSo I will take them to her; to Priscilla the May-flower of Plymouth,\nModest and simple and sweet, as a parting gift will I take them;\nBreathing their silent farewells, as they fade and wither and perish,\nSoon to be thrown away as is the heart of the giver.\"\nSo through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;\nCame to an open space, and saw the disk of the ocean,\nSailless, sombre and cold with the comfortless breath of the east-wind;\nSaw the new-built house and people at work in a meadow;\nHeard, as he drew near the door, the musical voice of Priscilla\nSinging the hundredth Psalm, the grand old Puritan anthem,\nMusic that Luther sang to the sacred words of the Psalmist,\nFull of the breath of the Lord, consoling and comforting many.\nThen, as he opened the door, he beheld the form of the maiden\nSeated beside her wheel, and the carded wool like a snow-drift\nPiled at her knee, her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle,\nWhile with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion.\nOpen wide on her lap lay the well-worn psalm-book of Ainsworth,\nPrinted in Amsterdam, the words and the music together,\nRough-hewn, angular notes, like stones in the wall of a churchyard\nDarkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses.\nSuch was the book from whose pages she sang the old Puritan anthem,\nShe, the Puritan girl, in the solitude of the forest,\nMaking the humble house and the modest apparel of home-spun\nBeautiful with her beauty, and rich with the wealth of her being!\nOver him rushed, like a wind that is keen and cold and relentless,\nThoughts of what might have been, and the weight and woe of his errand;\nAll the dreams that had faded, and all the hopes that had vanished,\nAll his life henceforth a dreary and tenantless mansion,\nHaunted by vain regrets, and pallid, sorrowful faces.\nStill he said to himself, and almost fiercely he said it,\n\"Let not him that putteth his hand to the plough look backwards;\nThough the ploughshare cut through the flowers of life to its fountains,\nThough it pass o'er the graves of the dead and the hearths of the living,\nIt is the will of the Lord; and his mercy endureth for ever!\"\nSo he entered the house: and the hum of the wheel and the singing\nSuddenly ceased; for Priscilla, aroused by his step on the threshold,\nRose as he entered, and gave him her hand, in signal of welcome,\nSaying, \"I knew it was you, when I heard your step in the passage;\nFor I was thinking of you, as I sat there singing and spinning.\"\nAwkward and dumb with delight, that a thought of him had been mingled\nThus in the sacred psalm, that came from the heart of the maiden,\nSilent before her he stood, and gave her the flowers for an answer,\nFinding no words for his thought. He remembered that day in the winter,\nAfter the first great snow, when he broke a path from the village,\nReeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the doorway,\nStamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house, and Priscilla\nLaughed at his snowy locks, and gave him a seat by the fireside,\nGrateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snow-storm.\nHad he but spoken then! perhaps not in vain had he spoken;\nNow it was all too late; the golden moment had vanished!\nSo he stood there abashed, and gave her the flowers for an answer.\nThen they sat down and talked of the birds and the beautiful Spring-time,\nTalked of their friends at home, and the Mayflower that sailed on the morrow.\n\"I have been thinking all day,\" said gently the Puritan maiden,\n\"Dreaming all night, and thinking all day, of the hedge-rows of England,\u2014\nThey are in blossom now, and the country is all like a garden;\nThinking of lanes and fields, and the song of the lark and the linnet,\nSeeing the village street, and familiar faces of neighbors\nGoing about as of old, and stopping to gossip together,\nAnd, at the end of the street, the village church, with the ivy\nClimbing the old gray tower, and the quiet graves in the churchyard.\nKind are the people I live with, and dear to me my religion;\nStill my heart is so sad, that I wish myself back in Old England.\nYou will say it is wrong, but I cannot help it: I almost\nWish myself back in Old England, I feel so lonely and wretched.\"\nThereupon answered the youth:\u2014\"Indeed I do not condemn you;\nStouter hearts than a woman's have quailed in this terrible winter.\nYours is tender and trusting, and needs a stronger to lean on;\nSo I have come to you now, with an offer and proffer of marriage\nMade by a good man and true, Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth!\"\nThus he delivered his message, the dexterous writer of letters,\u2014\nDid not embellish the theme, nor array it in beautiful phrases,\nBut came straight to the point, and blurted it out like a schoolboy;\nEven the Captain himself could hardly have said it more bluntly.\nMute with amazement and sorrow, Priscilla the Puritan maiden\nLooked into Alden's face, her eyes dilated with wonder,\nFeeling his words like a blow, that stunned her and rendered her speechless;\nTill at length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence:\n\"If the great Captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me,\nWhy does he not come himself, and take the trouble to woo me?\nIf I am not worth the wooing, I surely am not worth the winning!\"\nThen John Alden began explaining and smoothing the matter,\nMaking it worse as he went, by saying the Captain was busy,\u2014\nHad no time for such things;--such things! the words grating harshly\nFell on the ear of Priscilla; and swift as a flash she made answer:\n\"Has he no time for such things, as you call it, before he is married,\nWould he be likely to find it, or make it, after the wedding?\nThat is the way with you men; you don't understand us, you cannot.\nWhen you have made up your minds, after thinking of this one and that one,\nChoosing, selecting, rejecting, comparing one with another,\nThen you make known your desire, with abrupt and sudden avowal,\nAnd are offended and hurt, and indignant perhaps, that a woman\nDoes not respond at once to a love that she never suspected,\nDoes not attain at a bound the height to which you have been climbing.\nThis is not right nor just: for surely a woman's affection\nIs not a thing to be asked for, and had for only the asking.\nWhen one is truly in love, one not only says it, but shows it.\nHad he but waited awhile, had he only showed that he loved me,\nEven this Captain of yours--who knows?--at last might have won me,\nOld and rough as he is; but now it never can happen.\"\nStill John Alden went on, unheeding the words of Priscilla,\nUrging the suit of his friend, explaining, persuading, expanding;\nSpoke of his courage and skill, and of all his battles in Flanders,\nHow with the people of God he had chosen to suffer affliction,\nHow, in return for his zeal, they had made him Captain of Plymouth;\nHe was a gentleman born, could trace his pedigree plainly\nBack to Hugh Standish of Duxbury Hall, in Lancashire, England,\nWho was the son of Ralph, and the grandson of Thurston de Standish;\nHeir unto vast estates, of which he was basely defrauded,\nStill bore the family arms, and had for his crest a cock argent\nCombed and wattled gules, and all the rest of the blazon.\nHe was a man of honor, of noble and generous nature;\nThough he was rough, he was kindly; she knew how during the winter\nHe had attended the sick, with a hand as gentle as woman's;\nSomewhat hasty and hot, he could not deny it, and headstrong,\nStern as a soldier might be, but hearty, and placable always,\nNot to be laughed at and scorned, because he was little of stature;\nFor he was great of heart, magnanimous, courtly, courageous;\nAny woman in Plymouth, nay, any woman in England,\nMight be happy and proud to be called the wife of Miles Standish!\nBut as he warmed and glowed, in his simple and eloquent language,\nQuite forgetful of self, and full of the praise of his rival,\nArchly the maiden smiled, and, with eyes over-running with laughter,\nSaid, in a tremulous voice, \"Why don't you speak for yourself, John?\"\nInto the open air John Alden, perplexed and bewildered,\nRushed like a man insane, and wandered alone by the sea-side;\nPaced up and down the sands, and bared his head to the east-wind,\nCooling his heated brow, and the fire and fever within him.\nSlowly as out of the heavens, with apocalyptical splendors,\nSank the City of God, in the vision of John the Apostle,\nSo, with its cloudy walls of chrysolite, jasper, and sapphire,\nSank the broad red sun, and over its turrets uplifted\nGlimmered the golden reed of the angel who measured the city.\n\"Welcome, O wind of the East!\" he exclaimed in his wild exultation,\n\"Welcome, O wind of the East, from the caves of the misty Atlantic!\nBlowing o'er fields of dulse, and measureless meadows of sea-grass,\nBlowing o'er rocky wastes, and the grottos and gardens of ocean!\nLay thy cold, moist hand on my burning forehead, and wrap me\nClose in thy garments of mist, to allay the fever within me!\"\nLike an awakened conscience, the sea was moaning and tossing,\nBeating remorseful and loud the mutable sands of the sea-shore.\nFierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending;\nLove triumphant and crowned, and friendship wounded and bleeding,\nPassionate cries of desire, and importunate pleadings of duty!\n\"Is it my fault,\" he said, \"that the maiden has chosen between us?\nIs it my fault that he failed,--my fault that I am the victor?\"\nThen within him there thundered a voice, like the voice of the Prophet:\n\"It hath displeased the Lord!\"--and he thought of David's transgression,\nBathsheba's beautiful face, and his friend in the front of the battle!\nShame and confusion of guilt, and abasement and self-condemnation,\nOverwhelmed him at once; and he cried in the deepest contrition:\n\"It hath displeased the Lord! It is the temptation of Satan!\"\nThen, uplifting his head, he looked at the sea, and beheld there\nDimly the shadowy form of the Mayflower riding at anchor,\nRocked on the rising tide, and ready to sail on the morrow;\nHeard the voices of men through the mist, the rattle of cordage\nThrown on the deck, the shouts of the mate, and the sailors' \"Ay, ay, Sir!\"\nClear and distinct, but not loud, in the dripping air of the twilight.\nStill for a moment he stood, and listened, and stared at the vessel,\nThen went hurriedly on, as one who, seeing a phantom,\nStops, then quickens his pace, and follows the beckoning shadow.\n\"Yes, it is plain to me now,\" he murmured; \"the hand of the Lord is\nLeading me out of the land of darkness, the bondage of error,\nThrough the sea, that shall lift the walls of its waters around me,\nHiding me, cutting me off, from the cruel thoughts that pursue me.\nBack will I go o'er the ocean, this dreary land will abandon,\nHer whom I may not love, and him whom my heart has offended.\nBetter to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in England,\nClose by my mother's side, and among the dust of my kindred;\nBetter be dead and forgotten, than living in shame and dishonor!\nSacred and safe and unseen, in the dark of the narrow chamber\nWith me my secret shall lie, like a buried jewel that glimmers\nBright on the hand that is dust, in the chambers of silence and darkness,\u2014\nYes, as the marriage ring of the great espousal hereafter!\"\nThus as he spake, he turned, in the strength of his strong resolution,\nLeaving behind him the shore, and hurried along in the twilight,\nThrough the congenial gloom of the forest silent and sombre,\nTill he beheld the lights in the seven houses of Plymouth,\nShining like seven stars in the dusk and mist of the evening.\nSoon he entered his door, and found the redoubtable Captain\nSitting alone, and absorbed in the martial pages of Caesar,\nFighting some great campaign in Hainault or Brabant or Flanders.\n\"Long have you been on your errand,\" he said with a cheery demeanor,\nEven as one who is waiting an answer, and fears not the issue.\n\"Not far off is the house, although the woods are between us;\nBut you have lingered so long, that while you were going and coming\nI have fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city.\nCome, sit down, and in order relate to me all that has happened.\"\nThen John Alden spake, and related the wondrous adventure,\nFrom beginning to end, minutely, just as it happened;\nHow he had seen Priscilla, and how he had sped in his courtship,\nOnly smoothing a little, and softening down her refusal.\nBut when he came at length to the words Priscilla had spoken,\nWords so tender and cruel: \"Why don't you speak for yourself, John?\"\nUp leaped the Captain of Plymouth, and stamped on the floor, till his armor\nClanged on the wall, where it hung, with a sound of sinister omen.\nAll his pent-up wrath burst forth in a sudden explosion,\nEven as a hand-grenade, that scatters destruction around it.\nWildly he shouted, and loud: \"John Alden! you have betrayed me!\nMe, Miles Standish, your friend! have supplanted, defrauded, betrayed me!\nOne of my ancestors ran his sword through the heart of Wat Tyler;\nWho shall prevent me from running my own through the heart of a traitor?\nYours is the greater treason, for yours is a treason to friendship!\nYou, who lived under my roof, whom I cherished and loved as a brother;\nYou, who have fed at my board, and drunk at my cup, to whose keeping\nI have intrusted my honor, my thoughts the most sacred and secret,\u2014\nYou too, Brutus! ah woe to the name of friendship hereafter!\nBrutus was Caesar's friend, and you were mine, but henceforward\nLet there be nothing between us save war, and implacable hatred!\"\nSo spake the Captain of Plymouth, and strode about in the chamber,\nChafing and choking with rage; like cords were the veins on his temples.\nBut in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway,\nBringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance,\nRumors of danger and war and hostile incursions of Indians!\nStraightway the Captain paused, and, without further question or parley,\nTook from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron,\nBuckled the belt round his waist, and, frowning fiercely, departed.\nAlden was left alone. He heard the clank of the scabbard\nGrowing fainter and fainter, and dying away in the distance.\nThen he arose from his seat, and looked forth into the darkness,\nFelt the cool air blow on his cheek, that was hot with the insult,\nLifted his eyes to the heavens, and, folding his hands as in childhood,\nPrayed in the silence of night to the Father who seeth in secret.\nMeanwhile the choleric Captain strode wrathful away to the council,\nFound it already assembled, impatiently waiting his coming;\nMen in the middle of life, austere and grave in deportment,\nOnly one of them old, the hill that was nearest to heaven,\nCovered with snow, but erect, the excellent Elder of Plymouth.\nGod had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting,\nThen had sifted the wheat, as the living seed of a nation;\nSo say the chronicles old, and such is the faith of the people!\nNear them was standing an Indian, in attitude stern and defiant,\nNaked down to the waist, and grim and ferocious in aspect;\nWhile on the table before them was lying unopened a Bible,\nPonderous, bound in leather, brass-studded, printed in Holland,\nAnd beside it outstretched the skin of a rattle-snake glittered,\nFilled, like a quiver, with arrows; a signal and challenge of warfare,\nBrought by the Indian, and speaking with arrowy tongues of defiance.\nThis Miles Standish beheld, as he entered, and heard them debating\nWhat were an answer befitting the hostile message and menace,\nTalking of this and of that, contriving, suggesting, objecting;\nOne voice only for peace, and that the voice of the Elder,\nJudging it wise and well that some at least were converted,\nRather than any were slain, for this was but Christian behavior!\nThen out spake Miles Standish, the stalwart Captain of Plymouth,\nMuttering deep in his throat, for his voice was husky with anger,\n\"What! do you mean to make war with milk and the water of roses?\nIs it to shoot red squirrels you have your howitzer planted\nThere on the roof of the church, or is it to shoot red devils?\nTruly the only tongue that is understood by a savage\nMust be the tongue of fire that speaks from the mouth of the cannon!\"\nThereupon answered and said the excellent Elder of Plymouth,\nSomewhat amazed and alarmed at this irreverent language:\n\"Not so thought Saint Paul, nor yet the other Apostles;\nNot from the cannon's mouth were the tongues of fire they spake with!\"\nBut unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the Captain,\nWho had advanced to the table, and thus continued discoursing:\n\"Leave this matter to me, for to me by right it pertaineth.\nWar is a terrible trade; but in the cause that is righteous,\nSweet is the smell of powder; and thus I answer the challenge!\"\nThen from the rattlesnake's skin, with a sudden, contemptuous gesture,\nJerking the Indian arrows, he filled it with powder and bullets\nFull to the very jaws, and handed it back to the savage,\nSaying, in thundering tones: \"Here, take it! this is your answer!\"\nSilently out of the room then glided the glistening savage,\nBearing the serpent's skin, and seeming himself like a serpent,\nWinding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest.\nJust in the gray of the dawn, as the mists uprose from the meadows,\nThere was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of Plymouth;\nClanging and clicking of arms, and the order imperative, \"Forward!\"\nGiven in tone suppressed, a tramp of feet, and then silence.\nFigures ten, in the mist, marched slowly out of the village.\nStandish the stalwart it was, with eight of his valorous army,\nLed by their Indian guide, by Hobomok, friend of the white men,\nNorthward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage.\nGiants they seemed in the mist, or the mighty men of King David;\nGiants in heart they were, who believed in God and the Bible,\u2014\nAy, who believed in the smiting of Midianites and Philistines.\nOver them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning;\nUnder them loud on the sands, the serried billows, advancing,\nFired along the line, and in regular order retreated.\nMany a mile had they marched, when at length the village of Plymouth\nWoke from its sleep, and arose, intent on its manifold labors.\nSweet was the air and soft; and slowly the smoke from the chimneys\nRose over roofs of thatch, and pointed steadily eastward;\nMen came forth from the doors, and paused and talked of the weather,\nSaid that the wind had changed, and was blowing fair for the Mayflower;\nTalked of their Captain's departure, and all the dangers that menaced,\nHe being gone, the town, and what should be done in his absence.\nMerrily sang the birds, and the tender voices of women\nConsecrated with hymns the common cares of the household.\nOut of the sea rose the sun, and the billows rejoiced at his coming;\nBeautiful were his feet on the purple tops of the mountains;\nBeautiful on the sails of the Mayflower riding at anchor,\nBattered and blackened and worn by all the storms of the winter.\nLoosely against her masts was hanging and flapping her canvas,\nRent by so many gales, and patched by the hands of the sailors.\nSuddenly from her side, as the sun rose over the ocean,\nDarted a puff of smoke, and floated seaward; anon rang\nLoud over field and forest the cannon's roar, and the echoes\nHeard and repeated the sound, the signal-gun of departure!\nAh! but with louder echoes replied the hearts of the people!\nMeekly, in voices subdued, the chapter was read from the Bible,\nMeekly the prayer was begun, but ended in fervent entreaty!\nThen from their houses in haste came forth the Pilgrims of Plymouth,\nMen and women and children, all hurrying down to the sea-shore,\nEager, with tearful eyes, to say farewell to the Mayflower,\nHomeward bound o'er the sea, and leaving them here in the desert.\nForemost among them was Alden. All night he had lain without slumber,\nTurning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever.\nHe had beheld Miles Standish, who came back late from the council,\nStalking into the room, and heard him mutter and murmur,\nSometimes it seemed a prayer, and sometimes it sounded like swearing.\nOnce he had come to the bed, and stood there a moment in silence;\nThen he had turned away, and said: \"I will not awake him;\nLet him sleep on, it is best; for what is the use of more talking!\"\nThen he extinguished the light, and threw himself down on his pallet,\nDressed as he was, and ready to start at the break of the morning,\u2014\nCovered himself with the cloak he had worn in his campaigns in Flanders,\u2014\nSlept as a soldier sleeps in his bivouac, ready for action.\nBut with the dawn he arose; in the twilight Alden beheld him\nPut on his corselet of steel, and all the rest of his armor,\nBuckle about his waist his trusty blade of Damascus,\nTake from the corner his musket, and so stride out of the chamber.\nOften the heart of the youth had burned and yearned to embrace him,\nOften his lips had essayed to speak, imploring for pardon;\nAll the old friendship came back, with its tender and grateful emotions;\nBut his pride overmastered the nobler nature within him,\u2014\nPride, and the sense of his wrong, and the burning fire of the insult.\nSo he beheld his friend departing in anger, but spake not,\nSaw him go forth to danger, perhaps to death, and he spake not!\nThen he arose from his bed, and heard what the people were saying,\nJoined in the talk at the door, with Stephen and Richard and Gilbert,\nJoined in the morning prayer, and in the reading of Scripture,\nAnd, with the others, in haste went hurrying down to the sea-shore,\nDown to the Plymouth Rock, that had been to their feet as a door-step\nInto a world unknown,--the corner-stone of a nation!\nThere with his boat was the Master, already a little impatient\nLest he should lose the tide, or the wind might shift to the eastward,\nSquare-built, hearty, and strong, with an odor of ocean about him,\nSpeaking with this one and that, and cramming letters and parcels\nInto his pockets capacious, and messages mingled together\nInto his narrow brain, till at last he was wholly bewildered.\nNearer the boat stood Alden, with one foot placed on the gunwale,\nOne still firm on the rock, and talking at times with the sailors,\nSeated erect on the thwarts, all ready and eager for starting.\nHe too was eager to go, and thus put an end to his anguish,\nThinking to fly from despair, that swifter than keel is or canvas,\nThinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him.\nBut as he gazed on the crowd, he beheld the form of Priscilla\nStanding dejected among them, unconscious of all that was passing.\nFixed were her eyes upon his, as if she divined his intention,\nFixed with a look so sad, so reproachful, imploring, and patient,\nThat with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose,\nAs from the verge of a crag, where one step more is destruction.\nStrange is the heart of man, with its quick, mysterious instincts!\nStrange is the life of man, and fatal or fated are moments,\nWhereupon turn, as on hinges, the gates of the wall adamantine!\n\"Here I remain!\" he exclaimed, as he looked at the heavens above him,\nThanking the Lord whose breath had scattered the mist and the madness,\nWherein, blind and lost, to death he was staggering headlong.\n\"Yonder snow-white cloud, that floats in the ether above me,\nSeems like a hand that is pointing and beckoning over the ocean.\nThere is another hand, that is not so spectral and ghost-like,\nHolding me, drawing me back, and clasping mine for protection.\nFloat, O hand of cloud, and vanish away in the ether!\nRoll thyself up like a fist, to threaten and daunt me; I heed not\nEither your warning or menace, or any omen of evil!\nThere is no land so sacred, no air so pure and so wholesome,\nAs is the air she breathes, and the soil that is pressed by her footsteps.\nHere for her sake will I stay, and like an invisible presence\nHover around her for ever, protecting, supporting her weakness;\nYes! as my foot was the first that stepped on this rock at the landing,\nSo, with the blessing of God, shall it be the last at the leaving!\"\nMeanwhile the Master alert, but with dignified air and important,\nScanning with watchful eye the tide and the wind and the weather,\nWalked about on the sands; and the people crowded around him\nSaying a few last words, and enforcing his careful remembrance.\nThen, taking each by the hand, as if he were grasping a tiller,\nInto the boat he sprang, and in haste shoved off to his vessel,\nGlad in his heart to get rid of all this worry and flurry,\nGlad to be gone from a land of sand and sickness and sorrow,\nShort allowance of victual, and plenty of nothing but Gospel!\nLost in the sound of the oars was the last farewell of the Pilgrims.\nO strong hearts and true! not one went back in the Mayflower!\nNo, not one looked back, who had set his hand to this ploughing!\nSoon were heard on board the shouts and songs of the sailors\nHeaving the windlass round, and hoisting the ponderous anchor.\nThen the yards were braced, and all sails set to the west-wind,\nBlowing steady and strong; and the Mayflower sailed from the harbor,\nRounded the point of the Gurnet, and leaving far to the southward\nIsland and cape of sand, and the Field of the First Encounter,\nTook the wind on her quarter, and stood for the open Atlantic,\nBorne on the send of the sea, and the swelling hearts of the Pilgrims.\nLong in silence they watched the receding sail of the vessel,\nMuch endeared to them all, as something living and human;\nThen, as if filled with the spirit, and wrapt in a vision prophetic,\nBaring his hoary head, the excellent Elder of Plymouth\nSaid, \"Let us pray!\" and they prayed, and thanked the Lord and took courage.\nMournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock, and above them\nBowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death, and their kindred\nSeemed to awake in their graves, and to join in the prayer that they uttered.\nSun-illumined and white, on the eastern verge of the ocean\nGleamed the departing sail, like a marble slab in a graveyard;\nBuried beneath it lay for ever all hope of escaping.\nLo! as they turned to depart, they saw the form of an Indian,\nWatching them from the hill; but while they spake with each other,\nPointing with outstretched hands, and saying, \"Look!\" he had vanished.\nSo they returned to their homes; but Alden lingered a little,\nMusing alone on the shore, and watching the wash of the billows\nRound the base of the rock, and the sparkle and flash of the sunshine,\nLike the spirit of God, moving visibly over the waters.\nThus for a while he stood, and mused by the shore of the ocean,\nThinking of many things, and most of all of Priscilla;\nAnd as if thought had the power to draw to itself, like the loadstone,\nWhatsoever it touches, by subtile laws of its nature,\nLo! as he turned to depart, Priscilla was standing beside him.\n\"Are you so much offended, you will not speak to me?\" said she.\n\"Am I so much to blame, that yesterday, when you were pleading\nWarmly the cause of another, my heart, impulsive and wayward,\nPleaded your own, and spake out, forgetful perhaps of decorum?\nCertainly you can forgive me for speaking so frankly, for saying\nWhat I ought not to have said, yet now I can never unsay it;\nFor there are moments in life, when the heart is so full of emotion,\nThat if by chance it be shaken, or into its depths like a pebble\nDrops some careless word, it overflows, and its secret,\nSpilt on the ground like water, can never be gathered together.\nYesterday I was shocked, when I heard you speak of Miles Standish,\nPraising his virtues, transforming his very defects into virtues,\nPraising his courage and strength, and even his fighting in Flanders,\nAs if by fighting alone you could win the heart of a woman,\nQuite overlooking yourself and the rest, in exalting your hero.\nTherefore I spake as I did, by an irresistible impulse.\nYou will forgive me, I hope, for the sake of the friendship between us,\nWhich is too true and too sacred to be so easily broken!\"\nThereupon answered John Alden, the scholar, the friend of Miles Standish:\n\"I was not angry with you, with myself alone I was angry,\nSeeing how badly I managed the matter I had in my keeping.\"\n\"No!\" interrupted the maiden, with answer prompt and decisive;\n\"No; you were angry with me, for speaking so frankly and freely.\nIt was wrong, I acknowledge; for it is the fate of a woman\nLong to be patient and silent, to wait like a ghost that is speechless,\nTill some questioning voice dissolves the spell of its silence.\nHence is the inner life of so many suffering women\nSunless and silent and deep, like subterranean rivers\nRunning through caverns of darkness, unheard, unseen, and unfruitful,\nChafing their channels of stone, with endless and profitless murmurs.\"\nThereupon answered John Alden, the young man, the lover of women:\n\"Heaven forbid it, Priscilla; and truly they seem to me always\nMore like the beautiful rivers that watered the garden of Eden,\nMore like the river Euphrates, through deserts of Havilah flowing,\nFilling the land with delight, and memories sweet of the garden!\"\n\"Ah, by these words, I can see,\" again interrupted the maiden,\n\"How very little you prize me, or care for what I am saying.\nWhen from the depths of my heart, in pain and with secret misgiving,\nFrankly I speak to you, asking for sympathy only and kindness,\nStraightway you take up my words, that are plain and direct and in earnest,\nTurn them away from their meaning, and answer with flattering phrases.\nThis is not right, is not just, is not true to the best that is in you;\nFor I know and esteem you, and feel that your nature is noble,\nLifting mine up to a higher, a more ethereal level.\nTherefore I value your friendship, and feel it perhaps the more keenly\nIf you say aught that implies I am only as one among many,\nIf you make use of those common and complimentary phrases\nMost men think so fine, in dealing and speaking with women,\nBut which women reject as insipid, if not as insulting.\"\nMute and amazed was Alden; and listened and looked at Priscilla,\nThinking he never had seen her more fair, more divine in her beauty.\nHe who but yesterday pleaded so glibly the cause of another,\nStood there embarrassed and silent, and seeking in vain for an answer.\nSo the maiden went on, and little divined or imagined\nWhat was at work in his heart, that made him so awkward and speechless.\n\"Let us, then, be what we are, and speak what we think, and in all things\nKeep ourselves loyal to truth, and the sacred professions of friendship.\nIt is no secret I tell you, nor am I ashamed to declare it:\nI have liked to be with you, to see you, to speak with you always.\nSo I was hurt at your words, and a little affronted to hear you\nUrge me to marry your friend, though he were the Captain Miles Standish.\nFor I must tell you the truth: much more to me is your friendship\nThan all the love he could give, were he twice the hero you think him.\"\nThen she extended her hand, and Alden, who eagerly grasped it,\nFelt all the wounds in his heart, that were aching and bleeding so sorely,\nHealed by the touch of that hand, and he said, with a voice full of feeling:\n\"Yes, we must ever be friends; and of all who offer you friendship\nLet me be ever the first, the truest, the nearest and dearest!\"\nCasting a farewell look at the glimmering sail of the Mayflower,\nDistant, but still in sight, and sinking below the horizon,\nHomeward together they walked, with a strange, indefinite feeling,\nThat all the rest had departed and left them alone in the desert.\nBut, as they went through the fields in the blessing and smile of the sunshine,\nLighter grew their hearts, and Priscilla said very archly:\n\"Now that our terrible Captain has gone in pursuit of the Indians,\nWhere he is happier far than he would be commanding a household,\nYou may speak boldly, and tell me of all that happened between you,\nWhen you returned last night, and said how ungrateful you found me.\"\nThereupon answered John Alden, and told her the whole of the story,\u2014\nTold her his own despair, and the direful wrath of Miles Standish.\nWhereat the maiden smiled, and said between laughing and earnest,\n\"He is a little chimney, and heated hot in a moment!\"\nBut as he gently rebuked her, and told her how much he had suffered,\u2014\nHow he had even determined to sail that day in the Mayflower,\nAnd had remained for her sake, on hearing the dangers that threatened,\u2014\nAll her manner was changed, and she said with a faltering accent,\n\"Truly I thank you for this: how good you have been to me always!\"\nThus, as a pilgrim devout, who toward Jerusalem journeys,\nTaking three steps in advance, and one reluctantly backward,\nUrged by importunate zeal, and withheld by pangs of contrition;\nSlowly but steadily onward, receding yet ever advancing,\nJourneyed this Puritan youth to the Holy Land of his longings,\nUrged by the fervor of love, and withheld by remorseful misgivings.\nMeanwhile the stalwart Miles Standish was marching steadily northward,\nWinding through forest and swamp, and along the trend of the sea-shore,\nAll day long, with hardly a halt, the fire of his anger\nBurning and crackling within, and the sulphurous odor of powder\nSeeming more sweet to his nostrils than all the scents of the forest.\nSilent and moody he went, and much he revolved his discomfort;\nHe who was used to success, and to easy victories always,\nThus to be flouted, rejected, and laughed to scorn by a maiden,\nThus to be mocked and betrayed by the friend whom most he had trusted!\nAh! 't was too much to be borne, and he fretted and chafed in his armor!\n\"I alone am to blame,\" he muttered, \"for mine was the folly.\nWhat has a rough old soldier, grown grim and gray in the harness,\nUsed to the camp and its ways, to do with the wooing of maidens?\n'T was but a dream,--let it pass,--let it vanish like so many others!\nWhat I thought was a flower, is only a weed, and is worthless;\nOut of my heart will I pluck it, and throw it away, and henceforward\nBe but a fighter of battles, a lover and wooer of dangers!\"\nThus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort,\nWhile he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest,\nLooking up at the trees, and the constellations beyond them.\nAfter a three days' march he came to an Indian encampment\nPitched on the edge of a meadow, between the sea and the forest;\nWomen at work by the tents, and the warriors, horrid with war-paint,\nSeated about a fire, and smoking and talking together;\nWho, when they saw from afar the sudden approach of the white men,\nSaw the flash of the sun on breastplate and sabre and musket,\nStraightway leaped to their feet, and two, from among them advancing,\nCame to parley with Standish, and offer him furs as a present;\nFriendship was in their looks, but in their hearts there was hatred.\nBraves of the tribe were these, and brothers gigantic in stature,\nHuge as Goliath of Gath, or the terrible Og, king of Bashan;\nOne was Pecksuot named, and the other was called Wattawamat.\nRound their necks were suspended their knives in scabbards of wampum,\nTwo-edged, trenchant knives, with points as sharp as a needle.\nOther arms had they none, for they were cunning and crafty.\n\"Welcome, English!\" they said,--these words they had learned from the traders\nTouching at times on the coast, to barter and chaffer for peltries.\nThen in their native tongue they began to parley with Standish,\nThrough his guide and interpreter Hobomok, friend of the white man,\nBegging for blankets and knives, but mostly for muskets and powder,\nKept by the white man, they said, concealed, with the plague, in his cellars,\nReady to be let loose, and destroy his brother the red man!\nBut when Standish refused, and said he would give them the Bible,\nSuddenly changing their tone, they began to boast and to bluster.\nThen Wattawamat advanced with a stride in front of the other,\nAnd, with a lofty demeanor, thus vauntingly spake to the Captain:\n\"Now Wattawamat can see, by the fiery eyes of the Captain,\nAngry is he in his heart; but the heart of the brave Wattawamat\nIs not afraid at the sight. He was not born of a woman,\nBut on a mountain, at night, from an oak-tree riven by lightning,\nForth he sprang at a bound, with all his weapons about him,\nShouting, 'Who is there here to fight with the brave Wattawamat?'\"\nThen he unsheathed his knife, and, whetting the blade on his left hand,\nHeld it aloft and displayed a woman's face on the handle,\nSaying, with bitter expression and look of sinister meaning:\n\"I have another at home, with the face of a man on the handle;\nBy and by they shall marry; and there will be plenty of children!\"\nThen stood Pecksuot forth, self-vaunting, insulting Miles Standish:\nWhile with his fingers he petted the knife that hung at his bosom,\nDrawing it half from its sheath, and plunging it back, as he muttered,\n\"By and by it shall see; it shall eat; ah, ha! but shall speak not!\nThis is the mighty Captain the white men have sent to destroy us!\nHe is a little man; let him go and work with the women!\"\nMeanwhile Standish had noted the faces and figures of Indians\nPeeping and creeping about from bush to tree in the forest,\nFeigning to look for game, with arrows set on their bow-strings,\nDrawing about him still closer and closer the net of their ambush.\nBut undaunted he stood, and dissembled and treated them smoothly;\nSo the old chronicles say, that were writ in the days of the fathers.\nBut when he heard their defiance, the boast, the taunt, and the insult,\nAll the hot blood of his race, of Sir Hugh and of Thurston de Standish,\nBoiled and beat in his heart, and swelled in the veins of his temples.\nHeadlong he leaped on the boaster, and, snatching his knife from its scabbard,\nPlunged it into his heart, and, reeling backward, the savage\nFell with his face to the sky, and a fiendlike fierceness upon it.\nStraight there arose from the forest the awful sound of the war-whoop,\nAnd, like a flurry of snow on the whistling wind of December,\nSwift and sudden and keen came a flight of feathery arrows,\nThen came a cloud of smoke, and out of the cloud came the lightning,\nOut of the lightning thunder, and death unseen ran before it.\nFrightened the savages fled for shelter in swamp and in thicket,\nHotly pursued and beset; but their sachem, the brave Wattawamat,\nFled not; he was dead. Unswerving and swift had a bullet\nPassed through his brain, and he fell with both hands clutching the greensward,\nSeeming in death to hold back from his foe the land of his fathers.\nThere on the flowers of the meadow the warriors lay, and above them,\nSilent, with folded arms, stood Hobomok, friend of the white man.\nSmiling at length he exclaimed to the stalwart Captain of Plymouth:\n\"Pecksuot bragged very loud, of his courage, his strength, and his stature,\u2014\nMocked the great Captain, and called him a little man; but I see now\nBig enough have you been to lay him speechless before you!\"\nThus the first battle was fought and won by the stalwart Miles Standish.\nWhen the tidings thereof were brought to the village of Plymouth,\nAnd as a trophy of war the head of the brave Wattawamat\nScowled from the roof of the fort, which at once was a church and a fortress,\nAll who beheld it rejoiced, and praised the Lord, and took courage.\nOnly Priscilla averted her face from this spectre of terror,\nThanking God in her heart that she had not married Miles Standish;\nShrinking, fearing almost, lest, coming home from his battles,\nHe should lay claim to her hand, as the prize and reward of his valor.\nMonth after month passed away, and in Autumn the ships of the merchants\nCame with kindred and friends, with cattle and corn for the Pilgrims.\nAll in the village was peace; the men were intent on their labors,\nBusy with hewing and building, with garden-plot and with merestead,\nBusy with breaking the glebe, and mowing the grass in the meadows,\nSearching the sea for its fish, and hunting the deer in the forest.\nAll in the village was peace; but at times the rumor of warfare\nFilled the air with alarm, and the apprehension of danger.\nBravely the stalwart Miles Standish was scouring the land with his forces,\nWaxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies,\nTill his name had become a sound of fear to the nations.\nAnger was still in his heart, but at times the remorse and contrition\nWhich in all noble natures succeed the passionate outbreak,\nCame like a rising tide, that encounters the rush of a river,\nStaying its current awhile, but making it bitter and brackish.\nMeanwhile Alden at home had built him a new habitation,\nSolid, substantial, of timber rough-hewn from the firs of the forest.\nWooden-barred was the door, and the roof was covered with rushes;\nLatticed the windows were, and the window-panes were of paper,\nOiled to admit the light, while wind and rain were excluded.\nThere too he dug a well, and around it planted an orchard:\nStill may be seen to this day some trace of the well and the orchard.\nClose to the house was the stall, where, safe and secure from annoyance,\nRaghorn, the snow-white steer, that had fallen to Alden's allotment\nIn the division of cattle, might ruminate in the night-time\nOver the pastures he cropped, made fragrant by sweet pennyroyal.\nOft when his labor was finished, with eager feet would the dreamer\nFollow the pathway that ran through the woods to the house of Priscilla,\nLed by illusions romantic and subtile deceptions of fancy,\nPleasure disguised as duty, and love in the semblance of friendship.\nEver of her he thought, when he fashioned the walls of his dwelling;\nEver of her he thought, when he delved in the soil of his garden;\nEver of her he thought, when he read in his Bible on Sunday\nPraise of the virtuous woman, as she is described in the Proverbs,\u2014\nHow the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her always,\nHow all the days of her life she will do him good, and not evil,\nHow she seeketh the wool and the flax and worketh with gladness,\nHow she layeth her hand to the spindle and holdeth the distaff,\nHow she is not afraid of the snow for herself or her household,\nKnowing her household are clothed with the scarlet cloth of her weaving!\nSo as she sat at her wheel one afternoon in the Autumn,\nAlden, who opposite sat, and was watching her dexterous fingers,\nAs if the thread she was spinning were that of his life and his fortune,\nAfter a pause in their talk, thus spake to the sound of the spindle.\n\"Truly, Priscilla,\" he said, \"when I see you spinning and spinning,\nNever idle a moment, but thrifty and thoughtful of others,\nSuddenly you are transformed, are visibly changed in a moment;\nYou are no longer Priscilla, but Bertha the Beautiful Spinner.\"\nHere the light foot on the treadle grew swifter and swifter; the spindle\nUttered an angry snarl, and the thread snapped short in her fingers;\nWhile the impetuous speaker, not heeding the mischief, continued:\n\"You are the beautiful Bertha, the spinner, the queen of Helvetia;\nShe whose story I read at a stall in the streets of Southampton,\nWho, as she rode on her palfrey, o'er valley and meadow and mountain,\nEver was spinning her thread from a distaff fixed to her saddle.\nShe was so thrifty and good, that her name passed into a proverb.\nSo shall it be with your own, when the spinning-wheel shall no longer\nHum in the house of the farmer, and fill its chambers with music.\nThen shall the mothers, reproving, relate how it was in their childhood,\nPraising the good old times, and the days of Priscilla the spinner!\"\nStraight uprose from her wheel the beautiful Puritan maiden,\nPleased with the praise of her thrift from him whose praise was the sweetest,\nDrew from the reel on the table a snowy skein of her spinning,\nThus making answer, meanwhile, to the flattering phrases of Alden:\n\"Come, you must not be idle; if I am a pattern for housewives,\nShow yourself equally worthy of being the model of husbands.\nHold this skein on your hands, while I wind it, ready for knitting;\nThen who knows but hereafter, when fashions have changed and the manners,\nFathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of John Alden!\"\nThus, with a jest and a laugh, the skein on his hands she adjusted,\nHe sitting awkwardly there, with his arms extended before him,\nShe standing graceful, erect, and winding the thread from his fingers,\nSometimes chiding a little his clumsy manner of holding,\nSometimes touching his hands, as she disentangled expertly\nTwist or knot in the yarn, unawares--for how could she help it?\u2014\nSending electrical thrills through every nerve in his body.\nLo! in the midst of this scene, a breathless messenger entered,\nBringing in hurry and heat the terrible news from the village.\nYes; Miles Standish was dead!--an Indian had brought them the tidings,\u2014\nSlain by a poisoned arrow, shot down in the front of the battle,\nInto an ambush beguiled, cut off with the whole of his forces;\nAll the town would be burned, and all the people be murdered!\nSuch were the tidings of evil that burst on the hearts of the hearers.\nSilent and statue-like stood Priscilla, her face looking backward\nStill at the face of the speaker, her arms uplifted in horror;\nBut John Alden, upstarting, as if the barb of the arrow\nPiercing the heart of his friend had struck his own, and had sundered\nOnce and for ever the bonds that held him bound as a captive,\nWild with excess of sensation, the awful delight of his freedom,\nMingled with pain and regret, unconscious of what he was doing,\nClasped, almost with a groan, the motionless form of Priscilla,\nPressing her close to his heart, as for ever his own, and exclaiming:\n\"Those whom the Lord hath united, let no man put them asunder!\"\nEven as rivulets twain, from distant and separate sources,\nSeeing each other afar, as they leap from the rocks, and pursuing\nEach one its devious path, but drawing nearer and nearer,\nRush together at last, at their trysting-place in the forest;\nSo these lives that had run thus far in separate channels,\nComing in sight of each other, then swerving and flowing asunder,\nParted by barriers strong, but drawing nearer and nearer,\nRushed together at last, and one was lost in the other.\nForth from the curtain of clouds, from the tent of purple and scarlet,\nIssued the sun, the great High-Priest, in his garments resplendent,\nHoliness unto the Lord, in letters of light, on his forehead,\nRound the hem of his robe the golden bells and pomegranates.\nBlessing the world he came, and the bars of vapor beneath him\nGleamed like a grate of brass, and the sea at his feet was a laver!\nThis was the wedding morn of Priscilla the Puritan maiden.\nFriends were assembled together; the Elder and Magistrate also\nGraced the scene with their presence, and stood like the Law and the Gospel,\nOne with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven.\nSimple and brief was the wedding, as that of Ruth and of Boaz.\nSoftly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal,\nTaking each other for husband and wife in the Magistrate's presence,\nAfter the Puritan way, and the laudable custom of Holland.\nFervently then, and devoutly, the excellent Elder of Plymouth\nPrayed for the hearth and the home, that were founded that day in affection,\nSpeaking of life and of death, and imploring divine benedictions.\nLo! when the service was ended, a form appeared on the threshold,\nClad in armor of steel, a sombre and sorrowful figure!\nWhy does the bridegroom start and stare at the strange apparition?\nWhy does the bride turn pale, and hide her face on his shoulder?\nIs it a phantom of air,--a bodiless, spectral illusion?\nIs it a ghost from the grave, that has come to forbid the betrothal?\nLong had it stood there unseen, a guest uninvited, unwelcomed;\nOver its clouded eyes there had passed at times an expression\nSoftening the gloom and revealing the warm heart hidden beneath them,\nAs when across the sky the driving rack of the rain-cloud\nGrows for a moment thin, and betrays the sun by its brightness.\nOnce it had lifted its hand, and moved its lips, but was silent,\nAs if an iron will had mastered the fleeting intention.\nBut when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction,\nInto the room it strode, and the people beheld with amazement\nBodily there in his armor Miles Standish, the Captain of Plymouth!\nGrasping the bridegroom's hand, he said with emotion, \"Forgive me!\nI have been angry and hurt,--too long have I cherished the feeling;\nI have been cruel and hard, but now, thank God! it is ended.\nMine is the same hot blood that leaped in the veins of Hugh Standish,\nSensitive, swift to resent, but as swift in atoning for error.\nNever so much as now was Miles Standish the friend of John Alden.\"\nThereupon answered the bridegroom: \"Let all be forgotten between us,\u2014\nAll save the dear, old friendship, and that shall grow older and dearer!\"\nThen the Captain advanced, and, bowing, saluted Priscilla,\nGravely, and after the manner of old-fashioned gentry in England,\nSomething of camp and of court, of town and of country, commingled,\nWishing her joy of her wedding, and loudly lauding her husband.\nThen he said with a smile: \"I should have remembered the adage,\u2014\nIf you would be well served, you must serve yourself; and moreover,\nNo man can gather cherries in Kent at the season of Christmas!\"\nGreat was the people's amazement, and greater yet their rejoicing,\nThus to behold once more the sun-burnt face of their Captain,\nWhom they had mourned as dead; and they gathered and crowded about him,\nEager to see him and hear him, forgetful of bride and of bridegroom,\nQuestioning, answering, laughing, and each interrupting the other,\nTill the good Captain declared, being quite overpowered and bewildered,\nHe had rather by far break into an Indian encampment,\nThan come again to a wedding to which he had not been invited.\nMeanwhile the bridegroom went forth and stood with the bride at the doorway,\nBreathing the perfumed air of that warm and beautiful morning.\nTouched with autumnal tints, but lonely and sad in the sunshine,\nLay extended before them the land of toil and privation;\nThere were the graves of the dead, and the barren waste of the sea-shore,\nThere the familiar fields, the groves of pine, and the meadows;\nBut to their eyes transfigured, it seemed as the Garden of Eden,\nFilled with the presence of God, whose voice was the sound of the ocean.\nSoon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure,\nFriends coming forth from the house, and impatient of longer delaying,\nEach with his plan for the day, and the work that was left uncompleted.\nThen from a stall near at hand, amid exclamations of wonder,\nAlden the thoughtful, the careful, so happy, so proud of Priscilla,\nBrought out his snow-white steer, obeying the hand of its master,\nLed by a cord that was tied to an iron ring in its nostrils,\nCovered with crimson cloth, and a cushion placed for a saddle.\nShe should not walk, he said, through the dust and heat of the noonday;\nNay, she should ride like a queen, not plod along like a peasant.\nSomewhat alarmed at first, but reassured by the others,\nPlacing her hand on the cushion, her foot in the hand of her husband,\nGayly, with joyous laugh, Priscilla mounted her palfrey.\n\"Nothing is wanting now,\" he said with a smile, \"but the distaff;\nThen you would be in truth my queen, my beautiful Bertha!\"\nOnward the bridal procession now moved to their new habitation,\nHappy husband and wife, and friends conversing together.\nPleasantly murmured the brook, as they crossed the ford in the forest,\nPleased with the image that passed, like a dream of love through its bosom,\nTremulous, floating in air, o'er the depths of the azure abysses.\nDown through the golden leaves the sun was pouring his splendors,\nGleaming on purple grapes, that, from branches above them suspended,\nMingled their odorous breath with the balm of the pine and the fir-tree,\nWild and sweet as the clusters that grew in the valley of Eshcol.\nLike a picture it seemed of the primitive, pastoral ages,\nFresh with the youth of the world, and recalling Rebecca and Isaac,\nOld and yet ever new, and simple and beautiful always,\nLove immortal and young in the endless succession of lovers,\nSo through the Plymouth woods passed onward the bridal procession.\n",

  "text": "from the humid brick building below my humid brick building, a woman\nbellows at the pizza man. who, it seems, threw no cheese atop the crust\n& its red river of sauce because\u2014as he shouts above the sirens of State\nStreet & the growing crowd lined outside his shop\u2014it is Friday night\n& he is woefully short on mozzarella & there are far better pizza options\non every corner of this city, overpriced & tonight bursting at the seams\nwith lonely people who will seek the warmth spilling from the edges\nof a cardboard box & onto their laps & into their fingers on the walk\nback to a newly empty apartment. I love the heat for how it separates\nthe desire for touch from the practicality of it. If it gets too hot to fuck,\nlike it did for mookie & tina, then we\u2019re all on our own sinking islands\nanyway. there is no cheese in this town anymore & what could be worse\nthan the fraction of a dream behind every door you crawl to. it is friday & surely\nsome of my people are praising the fresh coin in their bank accounts & what\na tragedy to spend it on a half-finished freedom & the argument below has poured\nout into the streets & the waiting masses & I imagine this is no longer over\ncheese but over every mode of unfulfilled promise. the cluster of sins still stuck to a body\nfresh from the waters of baptism. the parent who must dig a grave for their youngest\nchild. from below, a man yells there are only three ingredients. you can\u2019t even get that right.\nisn\u2019t it funny, to vow that you will love someone until you are dead.\n",

  "text": "the poem begins not where the knife enters\nbut where the blade twists.\nSome wounds cannot be hushed\nno matter the way one writes of blood\n& what reflection arrives in its pooling.\nThe poem begins with pain as a mirror\ninside of which I adjust a tie the way my father taught me\nbefore my first funeral & so the poem begins\nwith old grief again at my neck. On the radio,\na singer born in a place where children watch the sky\nfor bombs is trying to sell me on love\nas something akin to war.\nI have no lie to offer as treacherous as this one.\nI was most like the bullet when I viewed the body as a door.\nI\u2019m past that now. No one will bury their kin\nwhen desire becomes a fugitive\nbetween us. There will be no folded flag\nat the doorstep. A person only gets to be called a widow once,\nand then they are simply lonely. The bluest period.\nGratitude, not for love itself, but for the way it can end\nwithout a house on fire.\nThis is how I plan to leave next.\nUnceremonious as birth in a country overrun\nby the ungrateful living. The poem begins with a chain\nof well-meaning liars walking one by one\noff the earth\u2019s edge. That\u2019s who died\nand made me king. Who died and made you.\n",

  "text": "LINES TRACED UNDER AN IMAGE OF AMOR THREATENING\nFear me, virgin whosoever \nTaking pride from love exempt, \nFear me, slighted. Never, never \nBrave me, nor my fury tempt: \nDowny wings, but wroth they beat \nTempest even in reason\u2019s seat. \n   Behind the house the upland falls \nWith many an odorous tree\u2014 \nWhite marbles gleaming through green halls\u2014 \nTerrace by terrace, down and down, \nAnd meets the star-lit Mediterranean Sea. \n   \u2019Tis Paradise. In such an hour \nSome pangs that rend might take release. \nNor less perturbed who keeps this bower \nOf balm, nor finds balsamic peace? \nFrom whom the passionate words in vent \nAfter long revery's discontent? \n   \u201cTired of the homeless deep, \nLook how their flight yon hurrying billows urge, \n   Hitherward but to reap \nPassive repulse from the iron-bound verge! \nInsensate, can they never know \n\u2019Tis mad to wreck the impulsion so? \n   \u201cAn art of memory is, they tell: \nBut to forget! forget the glade \nWherein Fate sprung Love's ambuscade, \nTo flout pale years of cloistral life \nAnd flush me in this sensuous strife. \n\u2019Tis Vesta struck with Sappho\u2019s smart. \nNo fable her delirious leap: \nWith more of cause in desperate heart, \nMyself could take it\u2014but to sleep! \n   \u201cNow first I feel, what all may ween, \nThat soon or late, if faded e\u2019en, \nOne\u2019s sex asserts itself. Desire, \nThe dear desire through love to sway, \nIs like the Geysers that aspire\u2014 \nThrough cold obstruction win their fervid way. \nBut baffled here\u2014to take disdain, \nTo feel rule\u2019s instinct, yet not reign; \nTo dote, to come to this drear shame\u2014 \nHence the winged blaze that sweeps my soul \nLike prairie-fires that spurn control, \nWhere withering weeds incense the flame. \n   \u201cAnd kept I long heaven\u2019s watch for this, \nContemning love, for this, even this? \nO terrace chill in Northern air, \nO reaching ranging tube I placed \nAgainst yon skies, and fable chased \nTill, fool, I hailed for sister there \nStarred Cassiopea in Golden Chair. \nIn dream I throned me, nor I saw \nIn cell the idiot crowned with straw. \n   \u201cAnd yet, ah yet, scarce ill I reigned, \nThrough self-illusion self-sustained, \nWhen now\u2014enlightened, undeceived\u2014 \nWhat gain I, barrenly bereaved! \nThan this can be yet lower decline\u2014 \nEnvy and spleen, can these be mine? \n   \u201cThe peasant-girl demure that trod \nBeside our wheels that climbed the way, \nAnd bore along a blossoming rod \nThat looked the sceptre of May-Day\u2014 \nOn her\u2014to fire this petty hell, \nHis softened glance how moistly fell! \nThe cheat! on briers her buds were strung; \nAnd wiles peeped forth from mien how meek. \nThe innocent bare-foot! young, so young! \nTo girls, strong man\u2019s a novice weak. \nTo tell such beads! And more remain, \nSad rosary of belittling pain. \n   \u201cWhen after lunch and sallies gay \nLike the Decameron folk we lay \nIn sylvan groups; and I\u2014let be! \nO, dreams he, can he dream that one \nBecause not roseate feels no sun? \nThe plain lone bramble thrills with Spring \nAs much as vines that grapes shall bring. \n   \u201cMe now fair studies charm no more. \nShall great thoughts writ, or high themes sung \nDamask wan cheeks\u2014unlock his arm \nAbout some radiant ninny flung? \nHow glad with all my starry lore, \nI\u2019d buy the veriest wanton\u2019s rose \nWould but my bee therein repose. \n   \u201cCould I remake me! or set free \nThis sexless bound in sex, then plunge \nDeeper than Sappho, in a lunge \nPiercing Pan\u2019s paramount mystery! \nFor, Nature, in no shallow surge \nAgainst thee either sex may urge, \nWhy hast thou made us but in halves\u2014 \nCo-relatives? This makes us slaves. \nIf these co-relatives never meet \nSelf-hood itself seems incomplete. \nAnd such the dicing of blind fate \nFew matching halves here meet and mate. \nWhat Cosmic jest or Anarch blunder \nThe human integral clove asunder \nAnd shied the fractions through life\u2019s gate? \n   \u201cYe stars that long your votary knew \nRapt in her vigil, see me here! \nWhither is gone the spell ye threw \nWhen rose before me Cassiopea? \nUsurped on by love's stronger reign\u2014 \nBut, lo, your very selves do wane: \nLight breaks\u2014truth breaks! Silvered no more, \nBut chilled by dawn that brings the gale \nShivers yon bramble above the vale, \nAnd disillusion opens all the shore.\u201d \n   One knows not if Urania yet \nThe pleasure-party may forget; \nOr whether she lived down the strain \nOf turbulent heart and rebel brain; \nFor Amor so resents a slight, \nAnd hers had been such haught disdain, \nHe long may wreak his boyish spite, \nAnd boy-like, little reck the pain. \n   One knows not, no. But late in Rome \n(For queens discrowned a congruous home) \nEntering Albani\u2019s porch she stood \nFixed by an antique pagan stone \nColossal carved. No anchorite seer, \nNot Thomas a Kempis, monk austere, \nReligious more are in their tone; \nYet far, how far from Christian heart \nThat form august of heathen Art. \nSwayed by its influence, long she stood, \nTill surged emotion seething down, \nShe rallied and this mood she won: \n   \u201cLanguid in frame for me, \nTo-day by Mary\u2019s convent-shrine, \nTouched by her picture\u2019s moving plea \nIn that poor nerveless hour of mine, \nI mused\u2014A wanderer still must grieve. \nHalf I resolved to kneel and believe, \nBelieve and submit, the veil take on. \nBut thee, arm\u2019d Virgin! less benign, \nThee now I invoke, thou mightier one. \nHelmeted woman\u2014if such term \nBefit thee, far from strife \nOf that which makes the sexual feud \nAnd clogs the aspirant life\u2014 \nO self-reliant, strong and free, \nThou in whom power and peace unite, \nTranscender! raise me up to thee, \nRaise me and arm me!\u201d \n                         Fond appeal. \nFor never passion peace shall bring, \nNor Art inanimate for long \nInspire. Nothing may help or heal \nWhile Amor incensed remembers wrong. \nVindictive, not himself he\u2019ll spare; \nFor scope to give his vengeance play \nHimself he\u2019ll blaspheme and betray. \n   Then for Urania, virgins everywhere, \nO pray! Example take too, and have care. \n",

Shall good in weak expire?\n   Needs goodness lack the evil grit,\nThat stares down censorship and ban,\nAnd dumbfounds saintlier ones with this\u2014\nGod\u2019s will avouched in each successful man?\n   Or, put it, where dread stress inspires\nA virtue beyond man\u2019s standard rate,\nSeems virtue there a strain forbid-\nTranscendence such as shares transgression\u2019s fate?\n   If so, and wan eclipse ensue,\nYet glory await emergence won,\nIs that high Providence, or Chance?\nAnd proved it which with thee, Timoleon?\n   O, crowned with laurel twined with thorn,\nNot rash thy life\u2019s cross-tide I stem,\nBut reck the problem rolled in pang\nAnd reach and dare to touch thy garment\u2019s hem.\nII\n   When Argos and Cleone strove\nAgainst free Corinth\u2019s claim or right,\nTwo brothers battled for her well:\nA footman one, and one a mounted knight.\n   Apart in place, each braved the brunt\nTill the rash cavalryman, alone,\nWas wrecked against the enemy\u2019s files,\nHis bayard crippled and he maimed and thrown.\n   Timoleon, at Timophanes\u2019 need,\nMakes for the rescue through the fray,\nCovers him with his shield, and takes\nThe darts and furious odds and fights at bay;\n   Till, wrought to pallor of passion dumb, \nStark terrors of death around he throws, \nWarding his brother from the field\nSpite failing friends dispersed and rallying foes.\n   Here might he rest, in claim rest here,\nRest, and a Phidian form remain;\nBut life halts never, life must on,\nAnd take with term prolonged some scar or stain.\n   Yes, life must on. And latent germs\nTime\u2019s seasons wake in mead and man;\nAnd brothers, playfellows in youth,\nDevelop into variance wide in span.\nIII\n   Timophanes was his mother\u2019s pride\u2014\nHer pride, her pet, even all to her\nWho slackly on Timoleon looked:\nScarce he (she mused) may proud affection stir.\n   He saved my darling, gossips tell:\nIf so, \u2019twas service, yea, and fair;\nBut instinct ruled and duty bade,\nIn service such, a henchman e\u2019en might share.\n   When boys they were I helped the bent;\nI made the junior feel his place,\nSubserve the senior, love him, too;\nAnd sooth he does, and that\u2019s his saving grace.\n   But me the meek one never can serve,\nNot he, he lacks the quality keen\nTo make the mother through the son\nAn envied dame of power, a social queen.\n   But thou, my first-born, thou art I\nIn sex translated; joyed, I scan\nMy features, mine, expressed in thee;\nThou art what I would be were I a man.\n   My brave Timophanes, \u2019tis thou\nWho yet the world\u2019s forefront shalt win,\nFor thine the urgent resolute way,\nSelf pushing panoplied self through thick and thin.\n   Nor here maternal insight erred:\nForsworn, with heart that did not wince\nAt slaying men who kept their vows,\nHer darling strides to power, and reigns\u2014a Prince.\nIV\n   Because of just heart and humane,\nProfound the hate Timoleon knew\nFor crimes of pride and men-of-prey\nAnd impious deeds that perjurous upstarts do;\n   And Corinth loved he, and in way\nOld Scotia\u2019s clansman loved his clan,\nDevotion one with ties how dear\nAnd passion that late to make the rescue ran.\n   But crime and kin\u2014the terrorised town,\nThe silent, acquiescent mother\u2014\nRevulsion racks the filial heart,\nThe loyal son, the patriot true, the brother.\n   In evil visions of the night\nHe sees the lictors of the gods, \nGiant ministers of righteousness,\nTheir fasces threatened by the Furies\u2019 rods.\n   But undeterred he wills to act,\nResolved thereon though Ate rise;\nHe heeds the voice whose mandate calls,\nOr seems to call, peremptory from the skies.\nV\n   Nor less but by approaches mild,\nAnd trying each prudential art,\nThe just one first advances him\nIn parley with a flushed intemperate heart.\n   The brother first he seeks\u2014alone,\nAnd pleads; but is with laughter met;\nThen comes he, in accord with two,\nAnd these adjure the tyrant and beset;\n   Whose merriment gives place to rage:\n\u201cGo,\u201d stamping, \u201cwhat to me is Right?\nI am the Wrong, and lo, I reign,\nAnd testily intolerant too in might\u201d:\n   And glooms on his mute brother pale,\nWho goes aside; with muffled face\nHe sobs the predetermined word,\nAnd Right in Corinth reassumes its place.\nVI\n   But on his robe, ah, whose the blood?\nAnd craven ones their eyes avert,\nAnd heavy is a mother\u2019s ban,\nAnd dismal faces of the fools can hurt.\n   The whispering-gallery of the world,\nWhere each breathed slur runs wheeling wide.\nEddies a false perverted truth,\nInveterate turning still on fratricide.\n   The time was Plato\u2019s. Wandering lights\nConfirmed the atheist\u2019s standing star;\nAs now, no sanction Virtue knew\nFor deeds that on prescriptive morals jar.\n   Reaction took misgiving\u2019s tone,\nInfecting conscience, till betrayed\nTo doubt the irrevocable doom\nHerself had authorised when undismayed.\n   Within perturbed Timoleon here\nSuch deeps were bared as when the sea,\nConvulsed, vacates its shoreward bed,\nAnd Nature\u2019s last reserves show nakedly.\n   He falters, and from Hades\u2019 glens\nBy night insidious tones implore\u2014\nWhy suffer? hither come and be\nWhat Phocion is who feeleth man no more.\n   But, won from that, his mood elects\nTo live\u2014to live in wilding place;\nFor years self-outcast, he but meets\nIn shades his playfellow\u2019s reproachful face.\n   Estranged through one transcendent deed\nFrom common membership in mart,\nIn severance he is like a head\nPale after battle trunkless found apart.\nVII\n   But flood-tide comes though long the ebb,\nNor patience bides with passion long;\nLike sightless orbs his thoughts are rolled\nArraigning heaven as compromised in wrong:\n   \u201cTo second causes why appeal?\nVain parleying here with fellow clods.\nTo you, Arch Principals, I rear\nMy quarrel, for this quarrel is with gods.\n   \u201cShall just men long to quit your world?\nIt is aspersion of your reign; \nYour marbles in the temple stand\u2014\nYourselves as stony and invoked in vain?\u201d\nAh, bear with one quite overborne,\nOlympians, if he chide ye now;\nMagnanimous be even though he rail\nAnd hard against ye set the bleaching brow.\u2014\n   \u201c If conscience doubt, she\u2019ll next recant.\nWhat basis then? O, tell at last,\nAre earnest natures staggering here\nBut fatherless shadows from no substance cast?\n   \u201cYea, are ye, gods? Then ye, \u2019tis ye\nShould show what touch of tie ye may,\nSince ye, too, if not wrung are wronged\nBy grievous misconceptions of your sway.\n   \u201cBut deign, some little sign be given-\nLow thunder in your tranquil skies;\nMe reassure, nor let me be\nLike a lone dog that for a master cries.\u201d\n \nVIII\n   Men\u2019s moods, as frames, must yield to years,\nAnd turns the world in fickle ways;\nCorinth recalls Timoleon\u2014ay,\nAnd plumes him forth, but yet with schooling phrase.\n   On Sicily\u2019s fields, through arduous wars,\nA peace he won whose rainbow spanned\nThe isle redeemed; and he was hailed\nDeliverer of that fair colonial land. \n   And Corinth clapt: Absolved, and more!\nJustice in long arrears is thine:\nNot slayer of thy brother, no,\nBut saviour of the state, Jove\u2019s soldier, man divine.\n   Eager for thee thy City waits:\nReturn! with bays we dress your door.\nBut he, the Isle\u2019s loved guest, reposed,\nAnd never for Corinth left the adopted shore.\n",

and tongues of languid flame\nLick every boom, and lambent show\nElectric \u2019gainst each face aloft;\nThe herds of clouds with bellowings go:\nThe black ship rears\u2014beset\u2014harassed,\nThen plunges far with luminous antlers vast.\n    In trim betimes they turn from land,\nSome shivered sails and spars they stow;\nOne watch, dismissed, they troll the can,\nWhile loud the billow thumps the bow\u2014\nVies with the fist that smites the board,\nObstreperous at each reveller\u2019s jovial word.\n    Of royal oak by storms confirmed,\nThe tested hull her lineage shows:\nVainly the plungings whelm her prow\u2014\nShe rallies, rears, she sturdier grows:\nEach shot-hole plugged, each storm-sail home,\nWith batteries housed she rams the watery dome.\nDim seen adrift through driving scud,\nThe wan moon shows in plight forlorn;\nThen, pinched in visage, fades and fades\nLike to the faces drowned at morn,\nWhen deeps engulfed the flag-ship\u2019s crew,\nAnd, shrilling round, the inscrutable haglets flew.\n    And still they fly, nor now they cry,\nBut constant fan a second wake,\nUnflagging pinions ply and ply,\nAbreast their course intent they take;\nTheir silence marks a stable mood,\nThey patient keep their eager neighborhood.\n    Plumed with a smoke, a confluent sea,\nHeaved in a combing pyramid full,\nSpent at its climax, in collapse\nDown headlong thundering stuns the hull:\nThe trophy drops; but, reared again,\nShows Mars\u2019 high-altar and contemns the main.\nRebuilt it stands, the brag of arms,\nTransferred in site\u2014no thought of where\nThe sensitive needle keeps its place,\nAnd starts, disturbed, a quiverer there;\nThe helmsman rubs the clouded glass\u2014\nPeers in, but lets the trembling portent pass.\n    Let pass as well his shipmates do\n(Whose dream of power no tremors jar)\nFears for the fleet convoyed astern:\n\"Our flag they fly, they share our star;\nSpain\u2019s galleons great in hull are stout:\nManned by our men\u2014like us they\u2019ll ride it out.\"\n    Tonight\u2019s the night that ends the week\u2014\nEnds day and week and month and year:\nA fourfold imminent flickering time,\nFor now the midnight draws anear:\nEight bells!

But shall the New\nRedeem the pledge the Old Year made,\nOr prove a self-asserting heir?\nBut healthy hearts few qualms invade:\nBy shot-chests grouped in bays \u2019tween guns\nThe gossips chat, the grizzled, sea-beat ones.\n    And boyish dreams some graybeards blab:\n\"To sea, my lads, we go no more\nWho share the Acapulco prize;\nWe\u2019ll all night in, and bang the door;\nOur ingots red shall yield us bliss:\nLads, golden years begin to-night with this!\"\n    Released from deck, yet waiting call,\nGlazed caps and coats baptized in storm,\nA watch of Laced Sleeves round the board\nDraw near in heart to keep them warm:\n\"Sweethearts and wives!\" clink, clink, they meet,\nAnd, quaffing, dip in wine their beards of sleet.\n\"Ay, let the star-light stay withdrawn,\nSo here her hearth-light memory fling,\nSo in this wine-light cheer be born,\nAnd honor\u2019s fellowship weld our ring\u2014\nHonor! our Admiral\u2019s aim foretold:\nA tomb or a trophy, and lo, \u2019t is a trophy and gold!\"\n   But he, a unit, sole in rank,\nApart needs keep his lonely state,\nThe sentry at his guarded door\nMute as by vault the sculptured Fate;\nBelted he sits in drowsy light,\nAnd, hatted, nods\u2014the Admiral of the White.\n    He dozes, aged with watches passed\u2014\nYears, years of pacing to and fro;\nHe dozes, nor attends the stir\nIn bullioned standards rustling low,\nNor minds the blades whose secret thrill\nPerverts overhead the magnet\u2019s Polar will:\u2014\nLess heeds the shadowing three that play\nAnd follow, follow fast in wake,\nUntiring wing and lidless eye\u2014\nAbreast their course intent they take;\nOr sigh or sing, they hold for good\nThe unvarying flight and fixed inveterate mood.\n    In dream at last his dozings merge,\nIn dream he reaps his victory\u2019s fruit;\nThe Flags-o\u2019-the-Blue, the Flags-o\u2019-the-Red,\nDipped flags of his country\u2019s fleets salute\nHis Flag-o\u2019-the-White in harbor proud\u2014\nBut why should it blench? Why turn to a painted shroud?\n    The hungry seas they hound the hull,\nThe sharks they dog the haglets\u2019 flight;\nWith one consent the winds, the waves\nIn hunt with fins and wings unite,\nWhile drear the harps in cordage sound\nRemindful wails for old Armadas drowned.\nHa\u2014yonder! are they Northern Lights?\nOr signals flashed to warn or ward?\nYea, signals lanced in breakers high;\nBut doom on warning follows hard:\nWhile yet they veer in hope to shun,\nThey strike! and thumps of hull and heart are one.\n    But beating hearts a drum-beat calls\nAnd prompt the men to quarters go;\nDiscipline, curbing nature, rules\u2014\nHeroic makes who duty know:\nThey execute the trump\u2019s command,\nOr in peremptory places wait and stand.\n    Yet cast about in blind amaze\u2014\nAs through their watery shroud they peer:\n\"We tacked from land: then how betrayed?\nHave currents swerved us\u2014snared us here?\"\nNone heed the blades that clash in place\nUnder lamps dashed down that lit the magnet\u2019s case.\nAh, what may live, who mighty swim,\nOr boat-crew reach that shore forbid,\nOr cable span? Must victors drown\u2014\nPerish, even as the vanquished did?\nMan keeps from man the stifled moan;\nThey shouldering stand, yet each in heart how lone.\n    Some heaven invoke; but rings of reefs\nPrayer and despair alike deride\nIn dance of breakers forked or peaked,\nPale maniacs of the maddened tide;\nWhile, strenuous yet some end to earn,\nThe haglets spin, though now no more astern.\n    Like shuttles hurrying in the looms\nAloft through rigging frayed they ply\u2014\nCross and recross\u2014weave and inweave,\nThen lock the web with clinching cry\nOver the seas on seas that clasp\nThe weltering wreck where gurgling ends the gasp.\nAh, for the Plate-Fleet trophy now,\nThe victor\u2019s voucher, flags and arms;\nNever they\u2019ll hang in Abbey old\nAnd take Time\u2019s dust with holier palms;\nNor less content, in liquid night,\nTheir captor sleeps\u2014the Admiral of the White.\n            Imbedded deep with shells\n            And drifted treasure deep,\n            Forever he sinks deeper in\n            Unfathomable sleep\u2014\n            His cannon round him thrown,\n            His sailors at his feet,\n            The wizard sea enchanting them\n            Where never haglets beat.\n            On nights when meteors play\n            And light the breakers dance,\n            The Oreads from the caves\n            With silvery elves advance;\n            And up from ocean stream,\n            And down from heaven far,\n            The rays that blend in dream\n            The abysm and the star.\n",

The next day brought\nA second.\n                 LATER FROM THE FORT.\nGrant's investment is complete\u2014\n        A semicircular one.\nBoth wings the Cumberland's margin meet,\nThen, backwkard curving, clasp the rebel seat.\n    On Wednesday this good work was done;\n    But of the doers some lie prone.\nEach wood, each hill, each glen was fought for;\nThe bold inclosing line we wrought for\nFlamed with sharpshooters. Each cliff cost\nA limb or life. But back we forced\nReserves and all; made good our hold;\nAnd so we rest.\n                               Events unfold.\nOn Thursday added ground was won,\n    A long bold steep: we near the Den.\nLater the foe came shouting down\n    In sortie, which was quelled; and then\nWe stormed them on their left.\nA chilly change in the afternoon;\nThe sky, late clear, is now bereft\nOf sun. Last night the ground froze hard\u2014\nRings to the enemy as they run\nWithin their works. A ramrod bites\nThe lip it meets. The cold incites\nTo swinging of arms with brisk rebound.\nSmart blows 'gainst lusty chests resound.\nAlong the outer line we ward\n    A crackle of skirmishing goes on.\nOur lads creep round on hand and knee,\n    They fight from behind each trunk and stone;\n    And sometimes, flying for refuge, one\nFinds 'tis an enemy shares the tree.\nSome scores are maimed by boughs shot off\n    In the glades by the Fort's big gun.\n    We mourn the loss of colonel Morrison,\n    Killed while cheering his regiment on.\nTheir far sharpshooters try our stuff;\nAnd ours return them puff for puff:\n'Tis diamond-cutting-diamond work.\n    Woe on the rebel cannoneer\nWho shows his head. Our fellows lurk\n    Like Indians that waylay the deer\nBy the wild salt-spring.\u2014The sky is dun,\nFordooming the fall of Donelson.\nStern weather is all unwonted here.\n    The people of the country own\nWe brought it. Yea, the earnest North\nHas elementally issued forth\n    To storm this Donelson.\nFURTHER.\n                       A yelling rout\nOf ragamuffins broke profuse\n    To-day from out the Fort.\n    Sole uniform they wore, a sort\nOf patch, or white badge (as you choose)\n    Upon the arm. But leading these,\nOr mingling, were men of face\nAnd bearing of patrician race,\nSplendid in courage and gold lace\u2014\n    The officers. Before the breeze\nMade by their charge, down went our line;\nBut, rallying, charged back in force,\nAnd broke the sally; yet with loss.\nThis on the left; upon the right\nMeanwhile there was an answering fight;\n    Assailants and assailed reversed.\nThe charge too upward, and not down\u2014\nUp a steep ridge-side, toward its crown,\n    A strong redoubt. But they who first\nGained the fort's base, and marked the trees\nFelled, heaped in horned perplexities,\n    And shagged with brush; and swarming there\nFierce wasps whose sting was present death\u2014\nThey faltered, drawing bated breath,\n    And felt it was in vain to dare;\nYet still, perforce, returned the ball,\nFiring into the tangled wall\nTill ordered to come down. They came;\nBut left some comrades in their fame,\nRed on the ridge in icy wreath\nAnd hanging gardens of cold Death.\n    But not quite unavenged these fell;\nOur ranks once out of range, a blast\n    Of shrapnel and quick shell\nBurst on the rebel horde, still massed,\n    Scattering them pell-mell.\n             (This fighting\u2014judging what we read\u2014\n             Both charge and countercharge,\n             Would seem but Thursday's told at large,\n             Before in brief reported.\u2014Ed.)\nNight closed in about the Den\n    Murky and lowering. Ere long, chill rains.\nA night not soon to be forgot,\n    Reviving old rheumatic pains\nAnd longings for a cot.\nWe looked not then for changeful cheer;\nTents, coats, and blankets too much care.\n    No fires; a fire a mark presents;\n    Near by, the trees show bullet-dents.\nRations were eaten cold and raw.\n    The men well soaked, come snow; and more\u2014\nA midnight sally. Small sleeping done\u2014\n             But such is war;\nNo matter, we'll have Fort Donelson.\n                              \u201cUgh! ugh!\nTwill drag along\u2014drag along\u201d\nGrowled a cross patriot in the throng,\nHis battered umbrella like an ambulance-cover\nRiddled with bullet-holes, spattered all over.\n\u201cHurrah for Grant!\u201d cried a stripling shrill;\nThree urchins joined him with a will,\nAnd some of taller stature cheered.\nMeantime a Copperhead passed; he sneered.\n    \u201cWin or lose,\u201d he pausing said,\nCaps fly the same; all boys, mere boys;\nAny thing to make a noise.\n    Like to see the list of the dead;\nThese 'craven Southerners' hold out;\nAy, ay, they\u2019ll give you many a bout\u201d\n    \"We'll beat in the end, sir\"\nFirmly said one in staid rebuke,\nA solid merchant, square and stout.\n    \u201cAnd do you think it? that way tend, sir\u201d\nAsked the lean Cooperhead, with a look\nOf splenetic pity. \u201cYes, I do\u201d\nHis yellow death's head the croaker shook:\nThe country's ruined, that I know\u201d\nA shower of broken ice and snow,\n    In lieu of words, confuted him;\nThey saw him hustled round the corner go,\n    And each by-stander said\u2014Well suited him.\nNext day another crowd was seen\nIn the dark weather's sleety spleen.\nBald-headed to the storm came out\nA man, who, 'mid a joyous shout,\nSilently posted this brief sheet:\n        GLORIOUS VICTORY OF THE FLEET!\n        FRIDAY'S GREAT EVENT!\n        THE ENEMY'S WATER-BATTERIES BEAT!\n        WE SILENCED EVERY GUN!\n        THE OLD COMMODORE'S COMPLIMENTS SENT\n        PLUMP INTO DONELSON!\n\u201cWell, well, go on!\u201d exclaimed the crowd\nTo him who thus much read aloud.\nThat's all,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat! nothing more\u201d\n\u201cEnough for a cheer, though\u2014hip, hurrah!\"\nBut here's old Baldy come again\u2014\u201d\nMore news!\u201d\u2014And now a different strain.\n(Our own reporter a dispatch compiles,\n    As best he may, from varied sources.)\nLarge re-enforcements have arrived\u2014\n    Munitions, men, and horses\u2014\nFor Grant, and all debarked, with stores.\n    The enemy's field-works extend six miles\u2014\nThe gate still hid; so well contrived.\nYesterday stung us; frozen shores\n    Snow-clad, and through the drear defiles\nAnd over the desolate ridges blew\nA Lapland wind.\n                              The main affair\n Was a good two hours' steady fight\nBetween our gun-boats and the Fort.\n   The Louisville's wheel was smashed outright.\nA hundred-and-twenty-eight-pound ball\nCame planet-like through a starboard port,\nKilling three men, and wounding all\nThe rest of that gun's crew,\n(The captain of the gun was cut in two);\nThen splintering and ripping went\u2014\nNothing could be its continent.\n   In the narrow stream the Louisville,\nUnhelmed, grew lawless; swung around,\n   And would have thumped and drifted, till\nAll the fleet was driven aground,\nBut for the timely order to retire.\nSome damage from our fire, 'tis thought,\nWas done the water-batteries of the Fort.\nLittle else took place that day,\n   Except the field artillery in line\nWould now and then\u2014for love, they say\u2014\n             Exchange a valentine.\nThe old sharpshooting going on.\nSome plan afoot as yet unknown;\nSo Friday closed round Donelson.\nLATER.\n           Great suffering through the night\u2014\nA stinging one. Our heedless boys\n   Were nipped like blossoms. Some dozen\n   Hapless wounded men were frozen.\nDuring day being struck down out of sight,\nAnd help-cries drowned in roaring noise,\nThey were left just where the skirmish shifted\u2014\nLeft in dense underbrush now-drifted.\nSome, seeking to crawl in crippled plight,\nSo stiffened\u2014perished.\n                                         Yet in spite\nOf pangs for these, no heart is lost.\nHungry, and clothing stiff with frost,\nOur men declare a nearing sun\nShall see the fall of Donelson.\n    And this they say, yet not disown\nThe dark redoubts round Donelson,\n    And ice-glazed corpses, each a stone\u2014\n            A sacrifice to Donelson;\nThey swear it, and swerve not, gazing on\nA flag, deemed black, flying from Donelson.\nSome of the wounded in the wood\n    Were cared for by the foe last night,\nThough he could do them little needed good,\n    Himself being all in shivering plight.\nThe rebel is wrong, but human yet;\nHe's got a heart, and thrusts a bayonet.\nHe gives us battle with wondrous will\u2014\nThe bluff's a perverted Bunker Hill.\nThe stillness stealing through the throng\nThe silent thought and dismal fear revealed;\n                   They turned and went,\n            Musing on right and wrong\n            And mysteries dimly sealed\u2014\nBreasting the storm in daring discontent;\nThe storm, whose black flag showed in heaven,\nAs if to say no quarter there was given\n            To wounded men in wood,\n    Or true hearts yearning for the good\u2014\nAll fatherless seemed the human soul.\nBut next day brought a bitterer bowl\u2014\n    On the bulletin-board this stood;\n    Saturday morning at 3 A.M.\n         A stir within the Fort betrayed\n     That the rebels were getting under arms;\n         Some plot these early birds had laid.\n     But a lancing sleet cut him who stared\n     Into the storm. After some vague alarms,\n     Which left our lads unscared,\n     Out sallied the enemy at dim of dawn,\n         With cavalry and artillery, and went\n         In fury at our environment.\n     Under cover of shot and shell\n         Three columns of infantry rolled on,\n         Vomited out of Donelson\u2014\n     Rolled down the slopes like rivers of hell,\n         Surged at our line, and swelled and poured\n     Like breaking surf. But unsubmerged\n         Our men stood up, except where roared\n     The enemy through one gap. We urged\n     Our all of manhood to the stress,\n     But still showed shattered in our desperateness.\n             Back set the tide,\n     But soon afresh rolled in;\n         And so it swayed from side to side\u2014\n     Far batteries joining in the din,\n     Though sharing in another fray\u2014\n         Till all became an Indian fight,\n     Intricate, dusky, stretching far away,\n     Yet not without spontaneous plan\n         However tangled showed the plight;\n     Duels all over 'tween man and man,\n     Duels on cliff-side, and down in ravine,\n         Duels at long range, and bone to bone;\n     Duels every where flitting and half unseen.\n         Only by courage good as their own,\n     And strength outlasting theirs,\n         Did our boys at last drive the rebels off.\n     Yet they went not back to their distant lairs\n         In strong-hold, but loud in scoff\n     Maintained themselves on conquered ground\u2014\n     Uplands; built works, or stalked around.\n     Our right wing bore this onset. Noon\n     Brought calm to Donelson.\nThe reader ceased; the storm beat hard;\n     'Twas day, but the office-gas was lit;\n     Nature retained her sulking-fit,\n             In her hand the shard.\nFlitting faces took the hue\nOf that washed bulletin-board in view,\nAnd seemed to bear the public grief\nAs private, and uncertain of relief;\nYea, many an earnest heart was won,\n     As broodingly he plodded on,\nTo find in himself some bitter thing,\nSome hardness in his lot as harrowing\n                 As Donelson.\nThat night the board stood barren there,\n    Oft eyes by wistful people passing,\n    Who nothing saw but the rain-beads chasing\nEach other down the wafered square,\nAs down some storm-beat grave-yard stone.\nBut next day showed\u2014\n                                        MORE NEWS LAST NIGHT.\nSTORY OF SATURDAY AFTERNOON.\nVICISSITUDES OF THE WAR.\n   The damaged gun-boats can't wage fight\nFor days; so says the Commodore.\nThus no diversion can be had.\nUnder a sunless sky of lead\n    Our grim-faced boys in blacked plight\nGaze toward the ground they held before,\nAnd then on Grant. He marks their mood,\nAnd hails it, and will turn the same to good.\nSpite all that they have undergone,\nTheir desperate hearts are set upon\nThis winter fort, this stubborn fort,\nThis castle of the last resort,\n                  This Donelson.\n1 P.M.\n                                    An order given\n    Requires withdrawal from the front\n    Of regiments that bore the brunt\nOf morning's fray. Their ranks all riven\nAre being replaced by fresh, strong men.\nGreat vigilance in the foeman's Den;\nHe snuffs the stormers. Need it is\nThat for that fell assault of his,\nThat rout inflicted, and self-scorn\u2014\nImmoderate in noble natures, torn\nBy sense of being through slackness overborne\u2014\nThe rebel be given a quick return:\nThe kindest face looks now half stern.\nBalked of their prey in airs that freeze,\nSome fierce ones glare like savages.\nAnd yet, and yet, strange moments are\u2014\nWell\u2014blood, and tears, and anguished War!\nThe morning's battle-ground is seen\n    In lifted glades, like meadows rare;\n    The blood-drops on the snow-crust there\nLike clover in the white-week show\u2014\n    Flushed fields of death, that call again\u2014\n    Call to our men, and not in vain,\nFor that way must the stormers go.\n3 P.M.\n                    The work begins.\nLight drifts of men thrown forward, fade\n    In skirmish-line along the slope,\nWhere some dislodgments must be made\n    Ere the stormer with the strong-hold cope.\nLew Wallace, moving to retake\nThe heights late lost\u2014\n                                  (Herewith a break.\n    Storms at the West derange the wires.\nDoubtless, ere morning, we shall hear\nThe end; we look for news to cheer\u2014\n    Let Hope fan all her fires.)\nNext day in large bold hand was seen\nThe closing bulletin:\n  VICTORY!\n                   Our troops have retrieved the day\nBy one grand surge along the line;\nThe spirit that urged them was divine.\n        The first works flooded, naught could stay\nThe stormers: on! still on!\nBayonets for Donelson!\n  Over the ground that morning lost\nRolled the blue billows, tempest-tossed,\n      Following a hat on the point of a sword.\nSpite shell and round-shot, grape and canister,\nUp they climbed without rail or banister\u2014\n      Up the steep hill-sides long and broad,\nDriving the rebel deep within his works.\n'Tis nightfall; not an enemy lurks\n      In sight. The chafing men\n             Fret for more fight:\n      \u201cTo-night, to-night let us take the Den\u201d\nBut night is treacherous, Grant is wary;\nOf brave blood be a little chary.\nPatience! the Fort is good as won;\nTo-morrow, and into Donelson.\n  LATER AND LAST.\n                                  THE FORT IS OURS.\n     A flag came out at early morn\nBringing surrender. From their towers\n      Floats out the banner late their scorn.\nIn Dover, hut and house are full\n      Of rebels dead or dying.\n      The national flag is flying\nFrom the crammed court-house pinnacle.\nGreat boat-loads of our wounded go\nTo-day to Nashville. The sleet-winds blow;\nBut all is right: the fight is won,\nThe winter-fight for Donelson.\n                          Hurrah!\nThe spell of old defeat is broke,\n      The Habit of victory begun;\nGrant strikes the war's first sounding stroke\n                              At Donelson.\n   For lists of killed and wounded, see\nThe morrow's dispatch: to-day 'tis victory.\nThe man who read this to the crowd\n    Shouted as the end he gained;\n    And though the unflagging tempest rained,\n          They answered him aloud.\nAnd hand grasped hand, and glances met\nIn happy triumph; eyes grew wet.\nO, to the punches brewed that night\nWent little water. Windows bright\nBeamed rosy on the sleet without,\nAnd from the deep street came the frequent shout;\nWhile some in prayer, as these in glee,\nBlessed heaven for the winter-victory.\nBut others were who wakeful laid\n    In midnight beds, and early rose,\n    And, feverish in the foggy snows,\nSnatched the damp paper\u2014wife and maid.\n    The death-list like a river flows\n            Down the pale sheet,\nAnd there the whelming waters meet.\n\n       Ah God! may Time with happy haste\n       Bring wail and triumph to a waste,\n               And war be done;\n       The battle flag-staff fall athwart\n       The curs'd ravine, and wither; naught\n              Be left of trench or gun;\n       The bastion, let it ebb away,\n       Washed with the river bed; and Day\n              In vain seek Donelson.\n",

  "text": "My two hunting dogs have names, but I rarely use them. As \nI go, they go: I lead; they follow, the blue-eyed one first, then\nthe one whose coloring\u2014her coat, not her eyes\u2014I sometimes \ncall never-again-o-never-this-way-henceforth. Hope, ambition: \nthese are not their names, though the way they run might suggest \notherwise. Like steam off night-soaked wooden fencing when \nthe sun first hits it, they rise each morning at my command. Late \nin the Iliad, Priam the king of Troy predicts his own murder\u2014\ncorrectly, except it won\u2019t be by spear, as he imagines, but by \nsword thrust. He can see his corpse, sees the dogs he\u2019s fed and \ntrained so patiently pulling the corpse apart. After that, he says,\nWhen they\u2019re full, they\u2019ll lie in the doorway, they\u2019ll lap my blood. \nI say: Why shouldn\u2019t they? Everywhere, the same people who \nmistake obedience for loyalty think somehow loyalty weighs more \nthan hunger, when it doesn\u2019t. At night, when it\u2019s time for bed, \nwe sleep together, the three of us: muscled animal, muscled animal, \nmuscled animal. The dogs settle to either side of me as if each \nwere the slightly folded wing of a beast from fable, part power, part \nrecognition. We breathe in a loose kind of unison. Our breathing \nripples the way oblivion does\u2014routinely, across history\u2019s face.\n",

I uncover the land\nWhich I hid of old time in the West,\nAs the sculptor uncovers the statue\nWhen he has wrought his best;\nI show Columbia, of the rocks\nWhich dip their foot in the seas,\nAnd soar to the air-borne flocks\nOf clouds, and the boreal fleece.\nI will divide my goods;\nCall in the wretch and slave:\nNone shall rule but the humble,\nAnd none but Toil shall have.\nI will have never a noble,\nNo lineage counted great;\nFishers and choppers and ploughmen\nShall constitute a state.\nGo, cut down trees in the forest,\nAnd trim the straightest boughs;\nCut down trees in the forest,\nAnd build me a wooden house.\nCall the people together,\nThe young men and the sires,\nThe digger in the harvest field,\nHireling, and him that hires;\nAnd here in a pine state-house\nThey shall choose men to rule\nIn every needful faculty,\nIn church, and state, and school.\nLo, now! if these poor men\nCan govern the land and sea,\nAnd make just laws below the sun,\nAs planets faithful be.\nAnd ye shall succor men;\n'T is nobleness to serve;\nHelp them who cannot help again:\nBeware from right to swerve.\nI break your bonds and masterships,\nAnd I unchain the slave:\nFree be his heart and hand henceforth\nAs wind and wandering wave.\nI cause from every creature\nHis proper good to flow:\nAs much as he is and doeth,\nSo much he shall bestow.\nBut, laying hands on another\nTo coin his labor and sweat,\nHe goes in pawn to his victim\nFor eternal years in debt.\nTo-day unbind the captive,\nSo only are ye unbound;\nLift up a people from the dust,\nTrump of their rescue, sound!\nPay ransom to the owner,\nAnd fill the bag to the brim.\nWho is the owner? The slave is owner,\nAnd ever was. Pay him.\nNorth! give him beauty for rags,\nAnd honor, South! for his shame;\nNevada! coin thy golden crags\nWith Freedom's image and name.\nUp! and the dusky race\nThat sat in darkness long,\u2014\nBe swift their feet as antelopes,\nAnd as behemoth strong.\nCome, East and West and North,\nBy races, as snow-flakes,\nAnd carry my purpose forth,\nWhich neither halts nor shakes.\nMy will fulfilled shall be,\nFor, in daylight or in dark,\nMy thunderbolt has eyes to see\nHis way home to the mark.\n",

  "text": "Give me your hand old Revolutionary,\nThe hill-top is nigh, but a few steps, (make room gentlemen,)\nUp the path you have follow'd me well, spite of your hundred and extra years,\nYou can walk old man, though your eyes are almost done,\nYour faculties serve you, and presently I must have them serve me.\nRest, while I tell what the crowd around us means,\nOn the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising,\nThere is the camp, one regiment departs to-morrow,\nDo you hear the officers giving their orders?\nDo you hear the clank of the muskets?\nWhy what comes over you now old man?\nWhy do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively?\nThe troops are but drilling, they are yet surrounded with smiles,\nAround them at hand the well-drest friends and the women,\nWhile splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down,\nGreen the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze,\nO'er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between.\nBut drill and parade are over, they march back to quarters,\nOnly hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!\nAs wending the crowds now part and disperse\u2014but we old man,\nNot for nothing have I brought you hither\u2014we must remain,\nYou to speak in your turn, and I to listen and tell.\n      The Centenarian\nWhen I clutch'd your hand it was not with terror,\nBut suddenly pouring about me here on every side,\nAnd below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes they ran,\nAnd where tents are pitch'd, and wherever you see south and south- east and south-west,\nOver hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,\nAnd along the shores, in mire (now fill'd over) came again and suddenly raged,\nAs eighty-five years agone no mere parade receiv'd with applause of friends,\nBut a battle which I took part in myself\u2014aye, long ago as it is, I took part in it,\nWalking then this hilltop, this same ground.\nAye, this is the ground,\nMy blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from graves,\nThe years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,\nRude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted,\nI see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay,\nI mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;\nHere we lay encamp'd, it was this time in summer also.\nAs I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,\nIt was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us here,\nBy his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle, he held up his unsheath'd sword,\nIt glitter'd in the sun in full sight of the army.\nTwas a bold act then\u2014the English war-ships had just arrived,\nWe could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,\nAnd the transports swarming with soldiers.\nA few days more and they landed, and then the battle.\nTwenty thousand were brought against us,\nA veteran force furnish'd with good artillery.\nI tell not now the whole of the battle,\nBut one brigade early in the forenoon order'd forward to engage the red-coats,\nOf that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march'd,\nAnd how long and well it stood confronting death.\nWho do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death?\nIt was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,\nRais'd in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known personally to the General.\nJauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus' waters,\nTill of a sudden unlook'd for by defiles through the woods, gain'd at night,\nThe British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing their guns,\nThat brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy's mercy.\nThe General watch'd them from this hill,\nThey made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment,\nThen drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the middle,\nBut O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!\nIt sickens me yet, that slaughter!\nI saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.\nI saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.\nMeanwhile the British manoeuvr'd to draw us out for a pitch'd battle,\nBut we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle.\nWe fought the fight in detachments,\nSallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was against us,\nOur foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us back to the works on this hill,\nTill we turn'd menacing here, and then he left us.\nThat was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,\nFew return'd, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.\nThat and here my General's first battle,\nNo women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude with applause,\nNobody clapp'd hands here then.\nBut in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,\nWearied that night we lay foil'd and sullen,\nWhile scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord off against us encamp'd,\nQuite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over their victory.\nSo dull and damp and another day,\nBut the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,\nSilent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my General retreated.\nI saw him at the river-side,\nDown by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;\nMy General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass'd over,\nAnd then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for the last time.\nEvery one else seem'd fill'd with gloom,\nMany no doubt thought of capitulation.\nBut when my General pass'd me,\nAs he stood in his boat and look'd toward the coming sun,\nI saw something different from capitulation.\n      Terminus\nEnough, the Centenarian's story ends,\nThe two, the past and present, have interchanged,\nI myself as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now speaking.\nAnd is this the ground Washington trod?\nAnd these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he cross'd,\nAs resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs?\nI must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward,\nI must preserve that look as it beam'd on you rivers of Brooklyn.\nSee\u2014as the annual round returns the phantoms return,\nIt is the 27th of August and the British have landed,\nThe battle begins and goes against us, behold through the smoke Washington's face,\nThe brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march'd forth to intercept the enemy,\nThey are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them,\nRank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,\nBaptized that day in many a young man's bloody wounds.\nIn death, defeat, and sisters', mothers' tears.\nAh, hills and slopes of Brooklyn! I perceive you are more valuable than your owners supposed;\nIn the midst of you stands an encampment very old,\nStands forever the camp of that dead brigade.\n",

Beware and arouse!)\nI'll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full of joy,\nThen loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,\nWith the banner and pennant a-flapping.\n                    Pennant\nCome up here, bard, bard,\nCome up here, soul, soul,\nCome up here, dear little child,\nTo fly in the clouds and winds with me, and play with the measureless light.\n                    Child\nFather what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger?\nAnd what does it say to me all the while?\n                    Father\nNothing my babe you see in the sky,\nAnd nothing at all to you it says\u2014but look you my babe,\nLook at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the money-shops opening,\nAnd see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with goods;\nThese, ah these, how valued and toil'd for these!\nHow envied by all the earth.\n                    Poet\nFresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high,\nOn floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels,\nOn floats the wind over the breast of the sea setting in toward land,\nThe great steady wind from west or west-by-south,\nFloating so buoyant with milk-white foam on the waters.\nBut I am not the sea nor the red sun,\nI am not the wind with girlish laughter,\nNot the immense wind which strengthens, not the wind which lashes,\nNot the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death,\nBut I am that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,\nWhich babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land,\nWhich the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings,\nAnd the shore-sands know and the hissing wave, and that banner and pennant,\nAloft there flapping and flapping.\n                    Child\nO father it is alive\u2014it is full of people\u2014it has children,\nO now it seems to me it is talking to its children,\nI hear it\u2014it talks to me\u2014O it is wonderful!\nO it stretches\u2014it spreads and runs so fast\u2014O my father,\nIt is so broad it covers the whole sky.\n                    Father\nCease, cease, my foolish babe,\nWhat you are saying is sorrowful to me, much 't displeases me;\nBehold with the rest again I say, behold not banners and pennants aloft,\nBut the well-prepared pavements behold, and mark the solid-wall'd houses.\n                    Banner and Pennant\nSpeak to the child O bard out of Manhattan,\nTo our children all, or north or south of Manhattan,\nPoint this day, leaving all the rest, to us over all\u2014and yet we know not why,\nFor what are we, mere strips of cloth profiting nothing,\nOnly flapping in the wind?\n                    Poet\nI hear and see not strips of cloth alone,\nI hear the tramp of armies, I hear the challenging sentry,\nI hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men, I hear Liberty!\nI hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing,\nI myself move abroad swift-rising flying then,\nI use the wings of the land-bird and use the wings of the sea-bird, and look down as from a height,\nI do not deny the precious results of peace, I see populous cities with wealth incalculable,\nI see numberless farms, I see the farmers working in their fields or barns,\nI see mechanics working, I see buildings everywhere founded, going up, or finish'd,\nI see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks drawn by the locomotives,\nI see the stores, depots, of Boston, Baltimore, Charleston, New Orleans,\nI see far in the West the immense area of grain, I dwell awhile hovering,\nI pass to the lumber forests of the North, and again to the Southern plantation, and again to California;\nSweeping the whole I see the countless profit, the busy gatherings, earn'd wages,\nSee the Identity formed out of thirty-eight spacious and haughty States, (and many more to come,)\nSee forts on the shores of harbors, see ships sailing in and out;\nThen over all, (aye! aye!) my little and lengthen'd pennant shaped like a sword,\nRuns swiftly up indicating war and defiance\u2014and now the halyards have rais'd it,\nSide of my banner broad and blue, side of my starry banner,\nDiscarding peace over all the sea and land.\n                    Banner and Pennant\nYet louder, higher, stronger, bard! yet farther, wider cleave!\nNo longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone,\nWe may be terror and carnage, and are so now,\nNot now are we any one of these spacious and haughty States, (nor any five, nor ten,)\nNor market nor depot we, nor money-bank in the city,\nBut these and all, and the brown and spreading land, and the mines below, are ours,\nAnd the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers great and small,\nAnd the fields they moisten, and the crops and the fruits are ours,\nBays and channels and ships sailing in and out are ours\u2014while we over all,\nOver the area spread below, the three or four millions of square miles, the capitals,\nThe forty millions of people,\u2014O bard! in life and death supreme,\nWe, even we, henceforth flaunt out masterful, high up above,\nNot for the present alone, for a thousand years chanting through you,\nThis song to the soul of one poor little child.\n                    Child\nO my father I like not the houses,\nThey will never to me be any thing, nor do I like money,\nBut to mount up there I would like, O father dear, that banner I like,\nThat pennant I would be and must be.\n                    Father\nChild of mine you fill me with anguish,\nTo be that pennant would be too fearful,\nLittle you know what it is this day, and after this day, forever,\nIt is to gain nothing, but risk and defy every thing,\nForward to stand in front of wars\u2014and O, such wars!\u2014what have you to do with them?\nWith passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?\n                    Banner\nDemons and death then I sing,\nPut in all, aye all will I, sword-shaped pennant for war,\nAnd a pleasure new and ecstatic, and the prattled yearning of children,\nBlent with the sounds of the peaceful land and the liquid wash of the sea,\nAnd the black ships fighting on the sea envelop'd in smoke,\nAnd the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars and pines,\nAnd the whirr of drums and the sound of soldiers marching, and the hot sun shining south,\nAnd the beach-waves combing over the beach on my Eastern shore, and my Western shore the same,\nAnd all between those shores, and my ever running Mississippi with bends and chutes,\nAnd my Illinois fields, and my Kansas fields, and my fields of Missouri,\nThe Continent, devoting the whole identity without reserving an atom,\nPour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with all and the yield of all,\nFusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole,\nNo more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,\nBut out of the night emerging for good, our voice persuasive no more,\nCroaking like crows here in the wind.\n                    Poet\nMy limbs, my veins dilate, my theme is clear at last,\nBanner so broad advancing out of the night, I sing you haughty and resolute,\nI burst through where I waited long, too long, deafen'd and blinded,\nMy hearing and tongue are come to me, (a little child taught me,)\nI hear from above O pennant of war your ironical call and demand,\nInsensate! insensate! (yet I at any rate chant you,) O banner!\nNot houses of peace indeed are you, nor any nor all their prosperity, (if need be, you shall again have every one of those houses to destroy them,\nYou thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing fast, full of comfort, built with money,\nMay they stand fast, then? not an hour except you above them and all stand fast;)\nO banner, not money so precious are you, not farm produce you, nor the material good nutriment,\nNor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the ships,\nNot the superb ships with sail-power or steam-power, fetching and carrying cargoes,\nNor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues\u2014but you as henceforth I see you,\nRunning up out of the night, bringing your cluster of stars, (ever-enlarging stars,)\nDivider of daybreak you, cutting the air, touch'd by the sun, measuring the sky,\n(Passionately seen and yearn'd for by one poor little child,\nWhile others remain busy or smartly talking, forever teaching thrift, thrift;)\nO you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like a snake hissing so curious,\nOut of reach, an idea only, yet furiously fought for, risking bloody death, loved by me,\nSo loved\u2014O you banner leading the day with stars brought from the night!\nValueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all\u2014(absolute owner of all)\u2014O banner and pennant!\nI too leave the rest\u2014great as it is, it is nothing\u2014houses, machines are nothing\u2014I see them not,\nI see but you, O warlike pennant! O banner so broad, with stripes, sing you only,\nFlapping up there in the wind.\n",

Inside, Texas\nsummer ice, I was wiped out\nby travel and illness, lying on a couch,\nwhich made me a good height for you to talk to.\nThat I had a son with the same name\nas you, struck you with wonder\u2014me, too\u2014\none name, one label, two beings. We said,\nto each other, I think, whatever came into\nour minds\u2014put there by what the other\nhad just said\u2014as if we threw,\none by one, taking turns, those\nintensely dried paper flowers\nof my childhood, into a glass of water,\nand watched them uncurl, fast, uneven,\nand bright\u2014and tossed another. We were in\nthe present moment, so intensely in it\neverything outside it took a step back,\nout of the light, then another step back.\nAnd that was where we met, next,\nyears later, in that light, you were so\nintent, alert, alive, as if\nin the grip of a fierce brightness, and moving\naround in it, quick in its grip. I wish I had\nbeen there, last week, to hear your best friend,\nwho had met you eye to eye\u2014in what,\nin your childhood, was the future\u2014talk of how\nextraordinary you were, my almost\nunknown dear, your mother\u2019s and father\u2019s\ndearest.

O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!\nO strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than steel!)\nHow you sprang\u2014how you threw off the costumes of peace with indifferent hand,\nHow your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard in their stead,\nHow you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude, songs of soldiers,)\nHow Manhattan drum-taps led.\nForty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,\nForty years as a pageant, till unawares the lady of this teeming and turbulent city,\nSleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,\nWith her million children around her, suddenly,\nAt dead of night, at news from the south,\nIncens'd struck with clinch'd hand the pavement.\nA shock electric, the night sustain'd it,\nTill with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour'd out its myriads.\nFrom the houses then and the workshops, and through all the doorways,\nLeapt they tumultuous, and lo! Manhattan arming.\nTo the drum-taps prompt,\nThe young men falling in and arming,\nThe mechanics arming, (the trowel, the jack-plane, the blacksmith's hammer, tost aside with precipitation,)\nThe lawyer leaving his office and arming, the judge leaving the court,\nThe driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down, throwing the reins abruptly down on the horses' backs,\nThe salesman leaving the store, the boss, book-keeper, porter, all leaving;\nSquads gather everywhere by common consent and arm,\nThe new recruits, even boys, the old men show them how to wear their accoutrements, they buckle the straps carefully,\nOutdoors arming, indoors arming, the flash of the musket-barrels,\nThe white tents cluster in camps, the arm'd sentries around, the sunrise cannon and again at sunset,\nArm'd regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and embark from the wharves,\n(How good they look as they tramp down to the river, sweaty, with their guns on their shoulders!\nHow I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces and their clothes and knapsacks cover'd with dust!)\nThe blood of the city up-arm'd! arm'd! the cry everywhere,\nThe flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the public buildings and stores,\nThe tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses his mother,\n(Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to detain him,)\nThe tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing the way,\nThe unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for their favorites,\nThe artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along, rumble lightly over the stones,\n(Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence,\nSoon unlimber'd to begin the red business;)\nAll the mutter of preparation, all the determin'd arming,\nThe hospital service, the lint, bandages and medicines,\nThe women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in earnest, no mere parade now;\nWar! an arm'd race is advancing! the welcome for battle, no turning away!\nWar! be it weeks, months, or years, an arm'd race is advancing to welcome it.\nMannahatta a-march\u2014and it's O to sing it well!\nIt's O for a manly life in the camp.\nAnd the sturdy artillery,\nThe guns bright as gold, the work for giants, to serve well the guns,\nUnlimber them! (no more as the past forty years for salutes for courtesies merely,\nPut in something now besides powder and wadding.)\nAnd you lady of ships, you Mannahatta,\nOld matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city,\nOften in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown'd amid all your children,\nBut now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta.\n",

  "text": "I\n\u201cAh, how short are the days! How soon the night overtakes us!\nIn the old country the twilight is longer; but here in the forest\nSuddenly comes the dark, with hardly a pause in its coming,\nHardly a moment between the two lights, the day and the lamplight;\nYet how grand is the winter! How spotless the snow is, and perfect!\u201d\nThus spake Elizabeth Haddon at nightfall to Hannah the housemaid,\nAs in the farm-house kitchen, that served for kitchen and parlor,\nBy the window she sat with her work, and looked on a landscape\nWhite as the great white sheet that Peter saw in his vision,\nBy the four corners let down and descending out of the heavens.\nCovered with snow were the forests of pine, and the fields and the meadows.\nNothing was dark but the sky, and the distant Delaware flowing\nDown from its native hills, a peaceful and bountiful river.\nThen with a smile on her lips made answer Hannah the housemaid:\n\u201cBeautiful winter! yea, the winter is beautiful, surely,\nIf one could only walk like a fly with one\u2019s feet on the ceiling.\nBut the great Delaware River is not like the Thames, as we saw it\nOut of our upper windows in Rotherhithe Street in the Borough,\nCrowded with masts and sails of vessels coming and going;\nHere there is nothing but pines, with patches of snow on their branches.\nThere is snow in the air, and see! it is falling already;\nAll the roads will be blocked, and I pity Joseph to-morrow,\nBreaking his way through the drifts, with his sled and oxen; and then, too,\nHow in all the world shall we get to Meeting on First-Day?\u201d\nBut Elizabeth checked her, and answered, mildly reproving:\n\u201cSurely the Lord will provide; for unto the snow he sayeth,\nBe thou on the earth, the good Lord sayeth; He is it\nGiveth snow like wool, like ashes scatters the hoar-frost.\u201d\nSo she folded her work and laid it away in her basket.\nMeanwhile Hannah the housemaid had closed and fastened the shutters,\nSpread the cloth, and lighted the lamp on the table, and placed there\nPlates and cups from the dresser, the brown rye loaf, and the butter\nFresh from the dairy, and then, protecting her hand with a holder,\nTook from the crane in the chimney the steaming and simmering kettle,\nPoised it aloft in the air, and filled up the earthen teapot,\nMade in Delft, and adorned with quaint and wonderful figures.\nThen Elizabeth said, \u201dLo! Joseph is long on his errand.\nI have sent him away with a hamper of food and of clothing\nFor the poor in the village. A good lad and cheerful is Joseph;\nIn the right place is his heart, and his hand is ready and willing.\u201d\nThus in praise of her servant she spake, and Hannah the housemaid\nLaughed with her eyes, as she listened, but governed her tongue, and was silent,\nWhile her mistress went on: \u201dThe house is far from the village;\nWe should be lonely here, were it not for Friends that in passing\nSometimes tarry o\u2019ernight, and make us glad by their coming.\u201d\nThereupon answered Hannah the housemaid, the thrifty, the frugal:\n\u201cYea, they come and they tarry, as if thy house were a tavern;\nOpen to all are its doors, and they come and go like the pigeons\nIn and out of the holes of the pigeon-house over the hayloft,\nCooing and smoothing their feathers and basking themselves in the sunshine.\u201d\nBut in meekness of spirit, and calmly, Elizabeth answered:\n\u201cAll I have is the Lord\u2019s, not mine to give or withhold it;\nI but distribute his gifts to the poor, and to those of his people\nWho in journeyings often surrender their lives to his service.\nHis, not mine, are the gifts, and only so far can I make them\nMine, as in giving I add my heart to whatever is given.\nTherefore my excellent father first built this house in the clearing;\nThough he came not himself, I came; for the Lord was my guidance,\nLeading me here for this service. We must not grudge, then, to others\nEver the cup of cold water, or crumbs that fall from our table.\u201d\nThus rebuked, for a season was silent the penitent housemaid;\nAnd Elizabeth said in tones even sweeter and softer:\n\u201cDost thou remember, Hannah, the great May-Meeting in London,\nWhen I was still a child, how we sat in the silent assembly,\nWaiting upon the Lord in patient and passive submission?\nNo one spake, till at length a young man, a stranger, John Estaugh,\nMoved by the Spirit, rose, as if he were John the Apostle,\nSpeaking such words of power that they bowed our hearts, as a strong wind\nBends the grass of the fields, or grain that is ripe for the sickle.\nThoughts of him to-day have been oft borne inward upon me,\nWherefore I do not know; but strong is the feeling within me\nThat once more I shall see a face I have never forgotten.\u201d\nII\nE\u2019en as she spake they heard the musical jangle of sleigh-bells,\nFirst far off, with a dreamy sound and faint in the distance,\nThen growing nearer and louder, and turning into the farmyard,\nTill it stopped at the door, with sudden creaking of runners.\nThen there were voices heard as of two men talking together,\nAnd to herself, as she listened, upbraiding said Hannah the housemaid,\n\u201cIt is Joseph come back, and I wonder what stranger is with him?\u201d\nDown from its nail she took and lighted the great tin lantern\nPierced with holes, and round, and roofed like the top of a lighthouse,\nAnd went forth to receive the coming guest at the doorway,\nCasting into the dark a network of glimmer and shadow\nOver the falling snow, the yellow sleigh, and the horses,\nAnd the forms of men, snow-covered, looming gigantic.\nThen giving Joseph the lantern, she entered the house with the stranger.\nYouthful he was and tall, and his cheeks aglow with the night air;\nAnd as he entered, Elizabeth rose, and, going to meet him,\nAs if an unseen power had announced and preceded his presence,\nAnd he had come as one whose coming had long been expected,\nQuietly gave him her hand, and said, \u201dThou art welcome, John Estaugh.\u201d\nAnd the stranger replied, with staid and quiet behavior,\n\u201cDost thou remember me still, Elizabeth? After so many\nYears have passed, it seemeth a wonderful thing that I find thee.\nSurely the hand of the Lord conducted me here to thy threshold.\nFor as I journeyed along, and pondered alone and in silence\nOn his ways, that are past finding out, I saw in the snow-mist,\nSeemingly weary with travel, a wayfarer, who by the wayside\nPaused and waited. Forthwith I remembered Queen Candace\u2019s eunuch,\nHow on the way that goes down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,\nReading Esaias the Prophet, he journeyed, and spake unto Philip,\nPraying him to come up and sit in his chariot with him.\nSo I greeted the man, and he mounted the sledge beside me,\nAnd as we talked on the way he told me of thee and thy homestead,\nHow, being led by the light of the Spirit, that never deceiveth,\nAnd I remembered thy name, and thy father and mother in England,\nAnd on my journey have stopped to see thee, Elizabeth Haddon.\nWishing to strengthen thy hand in the labors of love thou art doing.\u201d\nAnd Elizabeth answered with confident voice, and serenely\nLooking into his face with her innocent eyes as she answered,\n\u201cSurely the hand of the Lord is in it; his Spirit hath led thee\nOut of the darkness and storm to the light and peace of my fireside.\u201d\nThen, with stamping of feet, the door was opened, and Joseph\nEntered, bearing the lantern, and, carefully blowing the light out,\nHung it up on its nail, and all sat down to their supper;\nFor underneath that roof was no distinction of persons,\nBut one family only, one heart, one hearth and one household.\nWhen the supper was ended they drew their chairs to the fireplace,\nSpacious, open-hearted, profuse of flame and of firewood,\nLord of forests unfelled, and not a gleaner of fagots,\nSpreading its arms to embrace with inexhaustible bounty\nAll who fled from the cold, exultant, laughing at winter!\nOnly Hannah the housemaid was busy in clearing the table,\nComing and going, and hustling about in closet and chamber.\nThen Elizabeth told her story again to John Estaugh,\nGoing far back to the past, to the early days of her childhood;\nHow she had waited and watched, in all her doubts and besetments\nComforted with the extendings and holy, sweet inflowings\nOf the spirit of love, till the voice imperative sounded,\nAnd she obeyed the voice, and cast in her lot with her people\nHere in the desert land, and God would provide for the issue.\nMeanwhile Joseph sat with folded hands, and demurely\nListened, or seemed to listen, and in the silence that followed\nNothing was heard for a while but the step of Hannah the housemaid\nWalking the floor overhead, and setting the chambers in order.\nAnd Elizabeth said, with a smile of compassion, \u201dThe maiden\nHath a light heart in her breast, but her feet are heavy and awkward.\u201d\nInwardly Joseph laughed, but governed his tongue, and was silent.\nThen came the hour of sleep, death\u2019s counterfeit, nightly rehearsal\nOf the great Silent Assembly, the Meeting of shadows, where no man\nSpeaketh, but all are still, and the peace and rest are unbroken!\nSilently over that house the blessing of slumber descended.\nBut when the morning dawned, and the sun uprose in his splendor,\nBreaking his way through clouds that encumbered his path in the heavens,\nJoseph was seen with his sled and oxen breaking a pathway\nThrough the drifts of snow; the horses already were harnessed,\nAnd John Estaugh was standing and taking leave at the threshold,\nSaying that he should return at the Meeting in May; while above\nthem Hannah the housemaid, the homely, was looking out of the attic,\nLaughing aloud at Joseph, then suddenly closing the casement,\nAs the bird in a cuckoo-clock peeps out of its window,\nThen disappears again, and closes the shutter behind it.\nIII\nNow was the winter gone, and the snow; and Robin the Redbreast\nBoasted on bush and tree it was he, it was he and no other\nThat had covered with leaves the Babes in the Wood, and blithely\nAll the birds sang with him, and little cared for his boasting,\nOr for his Babes in the Wood, or the Cruel Uncle, and only\nSang for the mates they had chosen, and cared for the nests they were building.\nWith them, but more sedately and meekly, Elizabeth Haddon\nSang in her inmost heart, but her lips were silent and songless.\nThus came the lovely spring with a rush of blossoms and music,\nFlooding the earth with flowers, and the air with melodies vernal.\nThen it came to pass, one pleasant morning, that slowly\nUp the road there came a cavalcade, as of pilgrims\nMen and women, wending their way to the Quarterly Meeting\nIn the neighboring town; and with them came riding John Estaugh.\nAt Elizabeth\u2019s door they stopped to rest, and alighting\nTasted the currant wine, and the bread of rye, and the honey\nBrought from the hives, that stood by the sunny wall of the garden;\nThen remounted their horses, refreshed, and continued their journey,\nAnd Elizabeth with them, and Joseph, and Hannah the housemaid.\nBut, as they started, Elizabeth lingered a little, and leaning\nOver her horse\u2019s neck, in a whisper said to John Estaugh\n\u201cTarry awhile behind, for I have something to tell thee,\nNot to be spoken lightly, nor in the presence of others;\nThem it concerneth not, only thee and me it concerneth.\u201d\nAnd they rode slowly along through the woods, conversing together.\nIt was a pleasure to breathe the fragrant air of the forest;\nIt was a pleasure to live on that bright and happy May morning!\nThen Elizabeth said, though still with a certain reluctance,\nAs if impelled to reveal a secret she fain would have guarded:\n\u201cI will no longer conceal what is laid upon me to tell thee;\nI have received from the Lord a charge to love thee, John Estaugh.\u201d\nAnd John Estaugh made answer, surprised by the words she had spoken,\n\u201cPleasant to me are thy converse, thy ways, thy meekness of spirit;\nPleasant thy frankness of speech, and thy soul\u2019s immaculate whiteness,\nLove without dissimulation, a holy and inward adorning.\nBut I have yet no light to lead me, no voice to direct me.\nWhen the Lord\u2019s work is done, and the toil and the labor completed\nHe hath appointed to me, I will gather into the stillness\nOf my own heart awhile, and listen and wait for his guidance.\u201d\nThen Elizabeth said, not troubled nor wounded in spirit,\n\u201cSo is it best, John Estaugh. We will not speak of it further.\nIt hath been laid upon me to tell thee this, for to-morrow\nThou art going away, across the sea, and I know not\nWhen I shall see thee more; but if the Lord hath decreed it,\nThou wilt return again to seek me here and to find me.\u201d\nAnd they rode onward in silence, and entered the town with the others.\nIV\nShips that pass in the night, and speak each other in passing,\nOnly a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness;\nSo on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another,\nOnly a look and a voice, then darkness again and a silence.\nNow went on as of old the quiet life of the homestead.\nPatient and unrepining Elizabeth labored, in all things\nMindful not of herself, but bearing the burdens of others,\nAlways thoughtful and kind and untroubled; and Hannah the housemaid\nDiligent early and late, and rosy with washing and scouring,\nStill as of old disparaged the eminent merits of Joseph,\nAnd was at times reproved for her light and frothy behavior,\nFor her shy looks, and her careless words, and her evil surmisings,\nBeing pressed down somewhat like a cart with sheaves overladen,\nAs she would sometimes say to Joseph, quoting the Scriptures.\nMeanwhile John Estaugh departed across the sea, and departing\nCarried hid in his heart a secret sacred and precious,\nFilling its chambers with fragrance, and seeming to him in its sweetness\nMary\u2019s ointment of spikenard, that filled all the house with its odor.\nO lost days of delight, that are wasted in doubting and waiting!\nO lost hours and days in which we might have been happy!\nBut the light shone at last, and guided his wavering footsteps,\nAnd at last came the voice, imperative, questionless, certain.\nThen John Estaugh came back o\u2019er the sea for the gift that was offered,\nBetter than houses and lands, the gift of a woman\u2019s affection.\nAnd on the First-Day that followed, he rose in the Silent Assembly,\nHolding in his strong hand a hand that trembled a little,\nPromising to be kind and true and faithful in all things.\nSuch were the marriage rites of John and Elizabeth Estaugh.\nAnd not otherwise Joseph, the honest, the diligent servant,\nSped in his bashful wooing with homely Hannah the housemaid;\nFor when he asked her the question, she answered, \u201dNay\u201d; and then added\n\u201cBut thee may make believe, and see what will come of it, Joseph.\u201d\n",

God placed no dart\nOf war within your hands, but pow\u2019r to start\nTears, praise, love, joy, enwoven in a crest\nTo crown you glorious, brave ones of the soil.\n",

Pronounced through windows onto woods, onto lawns.\nSay \u201cLight casts its tender hieroglyphs on the mundane\nand cataclysmic equally,\u201d and fancify a nothing, go straight\nfor an inaccuracy that distracts and passes time.\nAnd light comes before the hieroglyph, and (as marker)\nthese hieroglyphs give meager insight into the \u201cnature\u201d of light beyond\nsome minor perceptions.

  "author": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow",
  "text": "At Atri in Abruzzo, a small town\nOf ancient Roman date, but scant renown,\nOne of those little places that have run\nHalf up the hill, beneath a blazing sun,\nAnd then sat down to rest, as if to say,\n\u201cI climb no farther upward, come what may,\u201d\nThe Re Giovanni, now unknown to fame,\nSo many monarchs since have borne the name,\nHad a great bell hung in the market-place\nBeneath a roof, projecting some small space,\nBy way of shelter from the sun and rain.\nThen rode he through the streets with all his train,\nAnd, with the blast of trumpets loud and long,\nMade proclamation, that whenever wrong\nWas done to any man, he should but ring\nThe great bell in the square, and he, the king,\nWould cause the Syndic to decide thereon.\nSuch was the proclamation of King John.\nHow swift the happy days in Atri sped,\nWhat wrongs were righted, need not here be said.\nSuffice it that, as all things must decay,\nThe hempen rope at length was worn away,\nUnravelled at the end, and, strand by strand,\nLoosened and wasted in the ringer\u2019s hand,\nTill one, who noted this in passing by,\nMended the rope with braids of briony,\nSo that the leaves and tendrils of the vine\nHung like a votive garland at a shrine.\nBy chance it happened that in Atri dwelt\nA knight, with spur on heel and sword in belt,\nWho loved to hunt the wild-boar in the woods,\nWho loved his falcons with their crimson hoods,\nWho loved his hounds and horses, and all sports\nAnd prodigalities of camps and courts;\u2014\nLoved, or had loved them; for at last, grown old,\nHis only passion was the love of gold.\nHe sold his horses, sold his hawks and hounds,\nRented his vineyards and his garden-grounds,\nKept but one steed, his favorite steed of all,\nTo starve and shiver in a naked stall,\nAnd day by day sat brooding in his chair,\nDevising plans how best to hoard and spare.\nAt length he said: \u201cWhat is the use or need\nTo keep at my own cost this lazy steed,\nEating his head off in my stables here,\nWhen rents are low and provender is dear?\nLet him go feed upon the public ways;\nI want him only for the holidays.\u201d\nSo the old steed was turned into the heat\nOf the long, lonely, silent, shadeless street;\nAnd wandered in suburban lanes forlorn,\nBarked at by dogs, and torn by brier and thorn.\nOne afternoon, as in that sultry clime\nIt is the custom in the summer time,\nWith bolted doors and window-shutters closed,\nThe inhabitants of Atri slept or dozed;\nWhen suddenly upon their senses fell\nThe loud alarum of the accusing bell!\nThe Syndic started from his deep repose,\nTurned on his couch, and listened, and then rose\nAnd donned his robes, and with reluctant pace\nWent panting forth into the market-place,\nWhere the great bell upon its cross-beam swung\nReiterating with persistent tongue,\nIn half-articulate jargon, the old song:\n\u201cSome one hath done a wrong, hath done a wrong!\u201d\nBut ere he reached the belfry\u2019s light arcade\nHe saw, or thought he saw, beneath its shade,\nNo shape of human form of woman born,\nBut a poor steed dejected and forlorn,\nWho with uplifted head and eager eye\nWas tugging at the vines of briony.\n\u201cDomeneddio!\u201d cried the Syndic straight,\n\u201cThis is the Knight of Atri\u2019s steed of state!\nHe calls for justice, being sore distressed,\nAnd pleads his cause as loudly as the best.\u201d\nMeanwhile from street and lane a noisy crowd\nHad rolled together like a summer cloud,\nAnd told the story of the wretched beast\nIn five-and-twenty different ways at least,\nWith much gesticulation and appeal\nTo heathen gods, in their excessive zeal.\nThe Knight was called and questioned; in reply\nDid not confess the fact, did not deny;\nTreated the matter as a pleasant jest,\nAnd set at naught the Syndic and the rest,\nMaintaining, in an angry undertone,\nThat he should do what pleased him with his own.\nAnd thereupon the Syndic gravely read\nThe proclamation of the King; then said:\n\u201cPride goeth forth on horseback grand and gay,\nBut cometh back on foot, and begs its way;\nFame is the fragrance of heroic deeds,\nOf flowers of chivalry and not of weeds!\nThese are familiar proverbs; but I fear\nThey never yet have reached your knightly ear.\nWhat fair renown, what honor, what repute\nCan come to you from starving this poor brute?\nHe who serves well and speaks not, merits more\nThan they who clamor loudest at the door.\nTherefore the law decrees that as this steed\nServed you in youth, henceforth you shall take heed\nTo comfort his old age, and to provide\nShelter in stall, and food and field beside.\u201d\nThe Knight withdrew abashed; the people all\nLed home the steed in triumph to his stall.\nThe King heard and approved, and laughed in glee,\nAnd cried aloud: \u201cRight well it pleaseth me!\nChurch-bells at best but ring us to the door;\nBut go not in to mass; my bell doth more:\nIt cometh into court and pleads the cause\nOf creatures dumb and unknown to the laws;\nAnd this shall make, in every Christian clime,\nThe Bell of Atri famous for all time.\u201d\n",

I wise up,\nknow their likenesses are only inked\n             on my shoulder\u2019s skin, their chipped ash poured\nin twin cinerary jars downstairs. Gone\n             is gone, said the goose to the shrunken boy\nin the mean-spirited Swedish children\u2019s book\n             I love. I shouldn\u2019t be writing this\nat this age or any other. She mothered\n             a part of me that needed that, lit\na spirit-lantern to spin shapes inside\n             my obituary head, even though\u2014\nI\u2019m nearly certain now\u2014she\u2019s dead.\n",
