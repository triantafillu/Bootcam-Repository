Five hours inhaling-exhaling bargains a short time to outfit a whole woman into her own dear self. \u00a0 We tied knots with every colour we could find. \u00a0 Understand, love always gets down to the wisp beyond fabric, to stroke the finest thread of a person \u2013 our making looms us legacies of holes \u2013 you fear cutting yourself short, me born running with scissors, and all of us rippling fast towards the great unravelling \u00a0 Yet the great thumping treadle of a heart can still say now you\u2019re mending \u2013 billow with the wind.",

Before the nurse saw the boar\u2019s scar coursing down his thigh where the world had first entered him in the forests of childhood. Before Penelope. Before his battle for her heart. Think of his moment alone on the shore, his sailors running up to the village where girls stood wringing spices from their hair. Think of the gods saying to him you do not have to praise ruin anymore; you do not have to praise what is lost. How you imagine him is how you enter things. He is kneeling. Or he is weeping. Or he is turning toward the sea again, thinking of the great deeds of the hopeless. Think of him lifting the sands and touching them to his tongue, to see if it is real. If it is home. If it is time. Think of the moment before he knew he had stepped out of the myths and into his life. Whether that means to you that he would sing, or mourn, or be lessened. And his patience when he rose up again and took himself the long way toward his kingdom, not knowing if it had all changed, or if love had lasted, or if anything can last. Think of him as though he were your life, as though you had sat waiting at a loom for long, dark years, weaving and unweaving what you are. Think of your life returning to you with eyes that had seen death. And whether you would look away if you saw him pausing a moment among the gardens and the horses, listening to the song of each thing, the common things he had forgotten. Think of him hearing your voice again, hiding his face in his hands as he listened, hearing a music of losses and joys, pestilence and bounty, a beauty that had prepared a place for him. And whether you would have him be changed by that, or return to what he was, or become what he had come this way to become.",

I hope its banks will be as crammed with the gold of marsh primrose as the Balder is now, that I may lift a riffle of trout from its bed for whatever journey is ahead, that the drum of the snipe will accompany the splash of the oar. Stop! Seneca says, striding across bog asphodel and moss, brandishing his umbrella, his wellies clarty with mud. O what madness to plot out such far-reaching hopes. Postpone nothing, count each day as a separate life and then he is gone, a particulate of mist.

Legs tucked beneath the cushion of her comfort, she\u2019d basked in the throb of my mantra.

The sea canes by the cliff flash green and silver;\nthey were the seraph lances of my faith,\nbut out of what is lost grows something stronger that has the rational radiance of stone,\nenduring moonlight, further than despair,\nstrong as the wind, that through dividing canes brings those we love before us, as they were,\nwith faults and all, not nobler, just there.",

The tide is full, the moon lies fair Upon the straits; on the French coast the light Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand, Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay. Come to the window, sweet is the night-air! Only, from the long line of spray Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land, Listen! you hear the grating roar Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling, At their return, up the high strand, Begin, and cease, and then again begin, With tremulous cadence slow, and bring The eternal note of sadness in.  Sophocles long ago Heard it on the \u00c6gean, and it brought Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow Of human misery; we Find also in the sound a thought, Hearing it by this distant northern sea.  The Sea of Faith Was once, too, at the full, and round earth\u2019s shore Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled. But now I only hear Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar, Retreating, to the breath Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear And naked shingles of the world.  Ah, love, let us be true To one another! for the world, which seems To lie before us like a land of dreams, So various, so beautiful, so new, Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light, Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; And we are here as on a darkling plain Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, Where ignorant armies clash by night.",

I cannot rest from travel: I will drink Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy\u2019d Greatly, have suffer\u2019d greatly, both with those That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when Thro\u2019 scudding drifts the rainy Hyades Vext the dim sea: I am become a name; For always roaming with a hungry heart Much have I seen and known; cities of men And manners, climates, councils, governments, Myself not least, but honour\u2019d of them all; And drunk delight of battle with my peers, Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. I am a part of all that I have met; Yet all experience is an arch wherethro\u2019 Gleams that untravell\u2019d world whose margin fades For ever and forever when I move. How dull it is to pause, to make an end, To rust unburnish\u2019d, not to shine in use! As tho\u2019 to breathe were life! Life piled on life Were all too little, and of one to me Little remains: but every hour is saved From that eternal silence, something more, A bringer of new things; and vile it were For some three suns to store and hoard myself, And this gray spirit yearning in desire To follow knowledge like a sinking star, Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is my son, mine own Telemachus, To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,\u2014 Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil This labour, by slow prudence to make mild A rugged people, and thro\u2019 soft degrees Subdue them to the useful and the good. Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere Of common duties, decent not to fail In offices of tenderness, and pay Meet adoration to my household gods, When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail: There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners, Souls that have toil\u2019d, and wrought, and thought with me\u2014 That ever with a frolic welcome took The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed Free hearts, free foreheads\u2014you and I are old; Old age hath yet his honour and his toil; Death closes all: but something ere the end, Some work of noble note, may yet be done, Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods. The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks: The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends, \u2018T is not too late to seek a newer world. Push off, and sitting well in order smite The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars, until I die. It may be that the gulfs will wash us down: It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. Tho\u2019 much is taken, much abides; and tho\u2019 We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are; One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.",

Thou by the Indian Ganges\u2019 side Shouldst rubies find; I by the tide Of Humber would complain. I would Love you ten years before the flood, And you should, if you please, refuse Till the conversion of the Jews. My vegetable love should grow Vaster than empires and more slow; An hundred years should go to praise Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze; Two hundred to adore each breast, But thirty thousand to the rest; An age at least to every part, And the last age should show your heart. For, lady, you deserve this state, Nor would I love at lower rate. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But at my back I always hear Time\u2019s wing\u00e8d chariot hurrying near; And yonder all before us lie Deserts of vast eternity. Thy beauty shall no more be found; Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound My echoing song; then worms shall try That long-preserved virginity, And your quaint honour turn to dust, And into ashes all my lust; The grave\u2019s a fine and private place, But none, I think, do there embrace. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now therefore, while the youthful hue Sits on thy skin like morning dew, And while thy willing soul transpires At every pore with instant fires, Now let us sport us while we may, And now, like amorous birds of prey, Rather at once our time devour Than languish in his slow-chapped power. Let us roll all our strength and all Our sweetness up into one ball, And tear our pleasures with rough strife Through the iron gates of life: Thus, though we cannot make our sun Stand still, yet we will make him run.",

In that moment, do they forget the training and think, if I do this, perhaps they will live? Can you train instinct? I\u2019m not sure. They see it all: the birth, the death, the vomit , the blood, the shock, the diseased, the perturbed, the pain, the smiles. I see them pressing their uniforms for the next shift, washing their hands with a soap that makes their palms peel.",

  "text": "So, after slavery, colonialism, two world wars, teddy-boys, skinheads, rivers of blood speech, neo-nazis, thatcher, 3 kids, 5 grandkids, a cosy council house, 20 floors up, a small pension, now you want to send me home. Oh Woooow! Even the sandwich van outside the station selling jerked chicken sandwiches, yet you claim not to know how they got here. Oh Wooowow! I can buy beef patties at a literary festival in Yorkshire. Truth is you were always planning my departure, from the moment I walked down the gangplank, freestyling \u201cLondon is the Place for Me\u201d. I notice you wasn\u2019t clapping\u2026or smiling. Can\u2019t help thinking this has always been the plan. In the long game, we\u2019ve drawn the short jab. We could hear it in the whispers, even as we squared your bedsheets and delivered your blue, veiny kids on the ward. As soon as the labour\u2019s done we could hear as we turned our backs: Darkie! Sambo! You must think we\u2019re dumb. Are we dumb? From the slaveships to world wars, to the underground and the hospitals, it\u2019s always been about the labour, never about the living. Cheap muscles and blood to build you an empire. It has never been about our living, never about our tambourine church, our Christmas rum cake, the audio-science of soundsystems. Our relationship has never been more than strained at best. Every second street name is a shout out to my captors. This one going out to the Wilberforces, who whipped a little less than the Beckfords. These are the streets we walk through. We need some black plaques on these buildings, godammit. Here lived Florence Scarborough between 1960 and 2005 and, boy, she took nooooooooo shit. My gran said, Let Enoch Powell come to Brixton, talking that river of blood shit to her face, and he\u2019d be tasting a river of salty blood in his mouth. To this day her grandchildren still bring that rage to the page. So the unspoken question remains: What to do with these darkies after we\u2019ve wrung them out\u2026AHA. Warm up them planes, boys, we are returning a cargo called Windrush generation. What do you mean my dad can\u2019t return from his holiday? The burden of proof is on us? Again? Think legality and lineage at the very least. Get the grand kids into a jail or two, or better yet kill them\u2026 in the street, on cctv, and cellphones, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s fine, they think. These people are an easy target. They do not organise, centralise or come as one; they\u2019ve got no major media outlets, or effective representation in government. We can send them back for months without this thing breaking. I smell subterfuge and sleight of hand. These people keep meticulous records of everything, even their genocidal imperatives. Hell, I could go online right now and check on the height, weight, condition and price of the slaves you brought and sold in your family, yet our records (poof!) disappeared. How can you be banished from your own home? Congratulations. You fooled us. Render your work, not your lives. This seems like the newest answer to an old question. Cheap muscle and blood to build you an Empire \u2013 that we can\u2019t stay in. Gran\u2019s gone missing from Saturday morning. Brixton Market? No one is frowning at the quality of the yams, or asking how the snapper\u2019s eye so cloudy. There\u2019ll be no Saturday soup tonight.",

Then pass down the aisle, as if on a conveyor belt of pure air, slow as a funeral cortege, past the congregants, some sinking to their knees in prayer. One woman, rocking back and forth, muttered, What about me Lord, why not me? \u00a0 The Risen stream slowly, so slowly out the gothic doors and up to the sky, finches darting deftly between them. \u00a0 Ten streets away, a husband tries to hold onto the feet of his floating wife. At times her force lifts him slightly off the ground, his grip slipping. He falls to his knees with just her high- heeled shoe in his hand. He shields and squints his eyes as she is backlit by the sun. \u00a0 A hundred people start floating from the windows of a tower block; from far enough away they could be black smoke from spreading flames. \u00a0 A father with his child on top his shoulders; men in sandcoloured galiibeas; a woman with an Elvis quiff and vintage glasses, a deep indigo hijab flapping in the wind; an artist in a wax-cloth headwrap: all airborne, these superheroes, this airborne pageantry of faith, this flock of believers. \u00a0 Amongst the cirrus clouds, floating like hair, they begin to look like a separate city.

I refuse to dress, but spend the day nude and pale against these walls. \u00a0 All buttocks and hips, you offer your hand as I streak past, strum the bow of my back with your palm, the left, and with the other, thumb my nipple as if it were braille; \u00a0 language written only for your touch, read through the soft pad of a finger or flit of your tongue as you bow to my breast, taking its small weight. \u00a0 On your knees, you trace the scar which seeps down my thigh like wax, as if to heal, then scan my legs for pocks, moles, flecks to count and christen; Nova, Leo, Sol. \u00a0 Later, we strain our tea, needles of jasmine, which I sip with stomach bared, doubled over itself in two full folds. Then, laughing, you step from your layers of cloth, \u00a0 sit beside me, skin to skin, until, wooed to bed, we hold each other; a coil of cool limbs, girlfriends, painting one another on the canvas of our linen sheet.",

GET. DOWN.\u2019 \u00a0 or 2:We go to a strip club. \u00a0 The game began, Emmett and Matt competing. So it\u2019s \u2018One, two, three, Go\u2019 and play on Go. One, two, three, Go. Both guys threw down scissors first. One, two, three, Go. Both changed tack dramatically and went for paper \u2013 all bets were off. One, two, three, Go. They cast their final shapes. Emmett, for the bier bar, stuck fatefully with paper while Matt, solidly in favour of the strip club, chose rock and lost. The decision had been made \u00a0 and I dwell on it for bathos, mainly, and because the world is made of games of rock, paper, scissors like this one. \u00a0 Not only in the sense that every flip or arbitrary choice has disproportionately huge and permanent results but in the sense that every gesture, either of victory or defeat, aggression or surrender, depends for its meaning on another. \u00a0 Put it this way: a photograph of Matt\u2019s third and losing move, viewed in isolation, appears to show a man raising his fist in anger, about to throw a punch. Only those who know which game of signs he\u2019s playing at will read the hand as rock. And even rock means nothing without further context: in rock, paper, scissors, rock is capable of meaning strength or weakness or indifference depending on the sign selected to contest it. \u00a0 We called an Uber to take us to London Bridge.",

This says less about ants than it does about the state of media in which we place ourselves: connected enough to hear and repeat all claims and verify some, yet prone to confirmation bias owing to algorithms which favour new expressions of that which we already hold to be true. \u00a0 Myth moves in step with commerce. When merchant ships arrived once per season from the Orient they brought silk and saffron and stories of dog-sized ants which mined gold and took to the sky only to defend their treasure from camel-riding thieves. Now we receive the exotic via fibre optics as a stream of high frequency trades. \u00a0 My love, I can\u2019t speak with authority on commodity futures, the wonders of the east and the behaviour of insects in Liverpool and Tunbridge Wells or any city outside my directly observable reality, but it\u2019s flying ant day in my heart if nowhere else. \u00a0",

One of the eyes was pressed against the side of the bag and seemed to be the only one that noticed me. This kitchen: \u00a0 the crack in the window; the spice rack with over a hundred tiny bottles; outside, my brother\u2019s underwear on the line \u2013 tiny boxer shorts in the drizzle; the fridge with a poster for bonfire night just gone, and a postcard from our aunty in Antigua, and a vase of plastic flowers on top \u2013 ultra-violet blue yellow purple making the green of the leaves seem quite improbable; beside it a small shelf peopled by Erna Brodber, Gus John; the door to the bathroom: \u00a0 I know that the floor is cold; there are three coiled hairs in the sink; a streak of toothpaste where my brother spits and never washes it out; I know that the toilet seat is cracked; I know what it\u2019s like to come in here when it\u2019s dark outside and turn the taps and feel the whole house warming up; the gradual breath the house takes through the wallpaper, the carpet, the timber, the kettle, the dutch pot, the kippers sparking in oil, the television, the toaster, the paraffin heater, and the first ray unencumbered by the clouds that spreads its rose palm on the kitchen window: \u00a0 I will be that for my brother and mother. I will be light touching their faces as she guts the fish, drains the peas.",

  "text": "When they lifted me my neck snapped and my head landed cheek down I saw the officer\u2019s foot jump back his hands shook as he wiped the soot I noticed the rudded gold of his watch how pink his nails gleamed through the gloves the white-gold ring like sausage string on a near translucent finger He paused and seemed to see me watch him searching for a gaze to meet He darted out his hand and grabbed my head and dropped it in a plastic bag I glimpsed myself beside the bed saw for a second my stiff black hands no nails or thumb or life line left no heart tattoo or amber palm \u00a0 the room was black the sky was black the smoke came through and breathed us in the house we knew the friends we left up they went in dust again I heard they found that boy you liked but couldn\u2019t say if it was him until they locked his mother\u2019s door with a key found winking in the ash \u00a0 They put me on a table beside my photograph a rubbish one that showed all my spots They blew it up so it was just my face But remember you were there to the right and remember how that afternoon we put our fists together and checked who was dark and who was light I was the darker one and wondered why it was I was not like you Why I hadn\u2019t been born browner or white When it did not seem that hard to do",

  "text": "The urn was heavy, small but so heavy, like the time, weeks before he died, when he needed to stand, I got my shoulder under his armpit, my cheek against his naked freckled warm back while she held the urinal for him-he had lost half his body weight and yet he was so heavy we could hardly hold him up while he got the fluid out crackling and sputtering like a wet fire. The urn had that six-foot heaviness, it began to warm in my hands as I held it, under the blue fir tree, stroking it. The shovel got the last earth out of the grave-it must have made that kind of gritty iron noise when they scraped his ashes out of the grate- the others would be here any minute and I wanted to open the urn as if then I would finally know him. On the wet lawn, under the cones cloaked in their rosin, I worked at the top, it gave and slipped off and there it was, the actual matter of his being: small, speckled lumps of bone like eggs; a discoloured curve of bone like a fungus grown around a branch; spotted pebbles-and the spots were in the channels of his marrow where the live orbs of the molecules swam as if by their own strong will and in each cell the chromosomes tensed and flashed, tore themselves away from themselves, leaving their shining duplicates. I looked at the jumble of shards like a crushed paper-wasp hive: was that a bone of his wrist, was that from the elegant knee he bent, was that his jaw, was that from his skull that at birth was flexible yet-I looked at him, bone and the ash it lay in, silvery white as the shimmering coils of dust the earth leaves behind it as it rolls, you can hear its heavy roaring as it rolls away.",

  "text": "(for Yusef Komunyakaa and Toi Derricotte) \u00a0 We were walking down Park, on the grates over the exhaust ducts of the lavish apartments, we were walking on air, on iron bars, three abreast-four breasts, two on either side of the man who had survived through various wars, my friend and I proud to walk him through the evening after his reading. Our skirts faffled, we were tall, we were his color guard, his woman of color and woman of no color guard, we were talking about family and race, and a greed or lust rose in me to talk about disliking myself. I was crouching slightly, spider-dancing over hot air, and I said, You want to know about white people? I\u2019ll tell you about white people, I lived in close proximity to them and I was them, that meanness they used on me was what I was made of. Out of the corner of my eye, I glimpsed myself for a second in a store window, a swirl of grey, a thirster after substance. My companions became quiet, as if they had pulled back, a bit, and were holding still, with wary courtesy. In that second, I could almost sense myself, whuffolk amok, one who wanted to win something in the war of the family, to rant in the faces of the war-struck about her home-front pain. It is hard to see oneself as dangerous and stupid, but what I had said was true, the people who had hurt me most were my makers, but there had not been what I saw now as a ring of haters round us, encircling us. I had a flash of knowledge of this on the sidewalk-as we kept going, I sensed two living beings, and one half idiot, a grey girl walking. Who did she think she was, to relish herself for hating herself, to savor, proudly, the luxury of hating her own people? All evening, I looked at my friends\u2019 womanly beauty, and manly beauty, and the table with its wines, and meats, and fruits, and flowers, I went back to the beginning.",

  "text": "Like other identical twins, they can be better told apart in adulthood. One is fast to wrinkle her brow, her brain, her quick intelligence. The other dreams inside a constellation, freckles of Orion. They were born when I was thirteen, they rose up, half out of my chest, now they\u2019re forty, wise, generous. I am inside them-in a way, under them, or I carry them, I\u2019d been alive so many years without them. I can\u2019t say I am them, though their feelings are almost my feelings, as with someone one loves. They seem, to me, like a gift that I have to give. That boys were said to worship their category of being, almost starve for it, did not escape me, and some young men loved them the way one would want, oneself, to be loved. All year they have been calling to my departed husband, singing to him, like a pair of soaking sirens on a scaled rock. They can\u2019t believe he\u2019s left them, it\u2019s not in their vocabulary, they being made of promise-they\u2019re like literally kept vows. Sometimes, now, I hold them a moment, one in each hand, twin widows, heavy with grief. They were a gift to me, and then they were ours, like thirsty nurslings of excitement and plenty. And now it\u2019s the same season again, the very week he moved out. Didn\u2019t he whisper to them, Wait here for me one year? No. He said, God be with you, God by with you, God-by, for the rest of this life and for the long nothing. And they do not know language, they are waiting for him, my Christ they are dumb, they do not even know they are mortal-sweet, I guess, refreshing to live with, beings without the knowledge of death, creatures of ignorant suffering.",

  "text": "When the blossoms were wilting, I cut the stalk and put it in a glass, before my trip-to have waiting, for me, the damp withering blooms to see, when I came back. I thought of the female side of my gene- alogy-the mothers, who have like to have waiting, upstairs a daughter stripped to be punished, and I realized I had been my mother\u2019s conduit to the satisfaction of being, in her own time, the beater. I think she did not know what she was doing. And it is nice, isn\u2019t it, to have something waiting, the knowledge of which will thrill you-how much drier will the blossoms be, how everted each pistil-tip on its coral stalk dusted with ocher seed? My mother and I were a twosome, as her mother and she had been, and her mother\u2019s mother . . .Mine used to perform a tune- not while she was beating on me- White coral bells, upon a silver stalk. It was a pleasure, for me, to behead-head-head-head the amaryllis, to slit its throat. The last verse was Oh don\u2019t you wish that you could hear them ring? That will happen only when the fairies sing-or in our case, when the dead mothers weep-my mother would weep, to read this.",

  "text": "When I was a connoisseuse of slugs I would part the ivy leaves, and look for the naked jelly of those gold bodies, translucent strangers glistening along the stones, slowly, their gelatinous bodies at my mercy. Made mostly of water, they would shrivel to nothing if they were sprinkled with salt, but I was not interested in that. What I liked was to draw aside the ivy, breathe the odor of the wall, and stand there in silence until the slug forgot I was there and sent its antennae up out of its head, the glimmering umber horns rising like telescopes, until finally the sensitive knobs would pop out the ends, delicate and intimate. Years later, when I first saw a naked man, I gasped with pleasure to see that quiet mystery reenacted, the slow elegant being coming out of hiding and gleaming in the dark air, eager and so trusting you could weep.",

I love to think of you then, so whole, so impervious, you and the clitoris as safe as the lives in which you were housed, they would have had to kill both my mother and me to get at either of you. I love her, at this moment, as the big fortress around me, the matronhead around the sweetmeat of my maidenhead. I don\u2019t know who invented you-to keep a girl\u2019s inwards clean and well-cupboarded. Dear wall, dear gate, dear stile, dear Dutch door, not a cat-flap nor a swinging door but a one-time pi\u00f1ata. How many places in the body were made to be destroyed once? You were very sturdy, weren\u2019t you, you took your job seriously-I\u2019d never felt such pain-you were the hourglass lady the magician saws in two. I was proud of you, turning to a cupful of the bright arterial ingredient. And how lucky we were, you and I, that we got to choose when, and with whom, and where, and why-plush pincushion, somehow related to statues that wept. It happened on the rug of a borrowed living room, but I felt as if we were in Diana\u2019s woods- he, and I, and you, together, or as if we were where the magma from the core of the earth burst up through the floor of the sea. Thank you for your life and death, thank you for your flower-girl walk before me, throwing down your scarlet petals. It would be years before I married-years before I carried, within me, a tiny, baby hymen, near the eggs with other teentsy hymens within them-but you unscrolled the carpet, leading me into the animal life of a woman. You were a sort of blood mother to me: first you held me close, for eighteen years, and then you let me go.",

We videoed your birth, your mother and her midwives and I together in the bedroom of our house; we thought of our first present to you as the address of your birthplace, the familiarity of your first bed. You were stuck in transition for a long time. I tell you this not to exact a price but because of the way my eyes were opened on your mother that day; away from where she groaned in the bedroom we took ourselves aside and discussed a C-Section, the trip to the hospital unless or if. I admired her also the way I admire athletes, exerting herself for a purpose \u2013 we used this language to prepare ourselves \u2013 those groans were the groans of a woman who did not allow the body to stop her. But I find it hard, almost impossible, to watch the video now; it unshields me in a way I did not think it would, in a way being there, holding her, then you, did not. When I say I will write this, she tells me, Remember how she was born because they lost the sound of her heart, why I had to push so hard and fast, tearing the skin because of that silence. May this always be a gift we give; we could not wait to hear you.",

The bee in the flower looks exotic, like a clownfish in an anemone, but there it is, by the sidewalk, in a neighbour\u2019s garden in the ordinary light. \u00a0 Is that what haiku is? a bee noticed in a flower? \u00a0 Basho said yes, and my favourite haiku is still his: \u00a0 A bee \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 staggers out \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of the peony. \u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s in the verb.

  "text": "I was a boy when the dinosaurs dragged their dead-weight tails through the museums of knowledge: so suffocating their mass, the marvel of it was they lived at all. \u00a0 But by the time I got to university, they had evolved: those tails rose from the mud and stuck straight out like yardarms, and they did a yardarm\u2019s work; the old monsters leapt up and raced, sleek Olympians. \u00a0 Out with the Frankensteinian shuffle and moan, in with hotfooting it after a jeep and roaring like three tenors into an oil drum. \u00a0 And now that I am the age of my students\u2019 fathers, the terrible lizards have clothed themselves in brilliant feathers \u2013 them and all their descendants who hatch from the symbols of birth and grow, singing, into the symbols of freedom. \u00a0 Everything changes, even extinction. \u00a0 But through it all, a constant \u2013 the tiny arms of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Everybody loves those arms, part puzzle, part mystery, part joke \u2013 hands that reach neither mouth nor prey, ridiculous limbs that interrupt the symmetry of an otherwise streamlined aesthetic, like the penis of a naked man in profile. \u00a0 Someday, check out the skeleton of a whale. There are leg bones there, tucked in the flesh like bits of shrapnel no one bothered to remove, a fact you know but never use in conversation. \u00a0 What if those Tyrannosaurus arms never showed, but stayed, creased upon themselves, remembering the time when the rest of the body wasn\u2019t so pure and efficient that it could strike with a neck like a bullwhip, crush and pound with trip-hammer legs, and lay open a Triceratops with its jackknife jaws alone? \u00a0 What if, inside that chest, the Tyrant King folded his secret hands in vestigial prayer? \u00a0 \u00a0 What would we have to laugh at then? How else could we make the terrifying monarch of life into a caricature of us, who have lived so briefly where he reigned so long? \u00a0",

  "author": "Richard Harrison",
  "text": "\u00a0 We couldn\u2019t find my father\u2019s ashes during the flood of 2013 and thought they had been swept away. Or maybe \u00a0 one of the volunteers, there only to do good, saw the jar that held them covered with silt and threw it out, as it went with so many things people cared for in the buried treasure of their homes \u00a0 family photographs, manual typewriters, diplomas under glass. \u00a0 After the river left our house, two of my wife\u2019s friends took apart our piano, which was waterlogged and could not be saved. \u00a0 And the piano, being demolished, made a concert from the jugular grief of crowed wood, the broken memory of glue and the squeal of screws no longer holding fast. \u00a0 It ended with the crash of the great harp onto a crib of concrete,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a zoo in panic, every note the piano knew climaxed at once, \u00a0 \u00a0 every animal howling as the river rose in their cages. \u00a0 At the news of my father\u2019s ashes lost to the water, my neighbours winced like something wild had eaten a pet they\u2019d all fed from their hands. \u00a0 But a friend from Poland thought it was hilarious, and so did I\u00a0 \u2013 we both come from a long line of cannon fodder. \u00a0 Dad would\u2019ve laughed, too. I\u2019d kept his ashes because nothing I\u2019d thought to do with them was right. He used to say, If you wait, things will solve themselves \u2013 the trick is knowing when to wait. \u00a0 I was reading Robert Hass\u2019s elegy for his younger brother with Robert\u2019s mind caught up imagining a funeral in which his brother\u2019s body was burned on a boat in the river, \u00a0 so first the fire, and then the air, and then, finally, the river took the body \u2013 as if downstream was another word for heaven. \u00a0 We found the jar in a box of books and a remote-controlled car taken to the kitchen when everyone grabbed everything above the waterline; it had never been touched by the river. \u00a0 And now it sits on a shelf in my living room, my father\u2019s ashes not taken by the flood that I will not give to the air until I have learned all he has to teach me with the last part of the earth that was him. \u00a0",

It fell beside your head before the ground filled up with soil again and lawn looked pristine. It covered the white-shrouded beauty, still wearing her red, embroidered blankets, perfectly smoothed.

He drags crumpled feet across the grassy powwow ground. \u00a0 Spurred by the drums, he joins in every one of the dances: the Smoke Dance, the Sneak-Up Dance, the Honor Dance. Falling, he is helped up on his feet again. \u00a0 A medicine man steps alongside him, passes the wing-feather of a golden eagle over and above him as he reels through the long day in hot sun. \u00a0 Someone puts a war-bonnet on his head to show who he really is. And now the sky-being soars. Still dancing, Cody is called up for the money prize. \u00a0",

  "text": "A song thrush calls clear among the hills, with his recurring note the rounded archway fills. \u00a0 The bride who walks sunwise up the path to the kirk door brings a ray of light, snowy foot on cobbled floor. \u00a0 A flower on her golden head by the stone-cut floret passes, the stirring of a breeze along the hilltop grasses. \u00a0 Where the bridegroom waits he has, for guard of honour, two-handed sword, rowel spurs, a carved warrior in armour. \u00a0 From a very early time love comes to live with them by the wedding-kiss, the blossom on the stem. \u00a0 By the blessing of the rings, two ripples in the pool, a bride and bridegroom meet as good as they are beautiful. \u00a0 Love follows in the footsteps of the constant and the leal: those who came here before, they are just as real. \u00a0 For a thousand years and more, voice to voice, their vows, and for all those yet to come, love is living in the now. \u00a0 Through the green wood of Stobo in the month of May these two will go to live and love always.",

  "text": "This is the tale of the woodsman\u2019s daughter. Born with a box\nof ashes set beside the bed,\nin case. Before the baby\u2019s first cry, he rolled her face into the cinders,\nheld it. Weak from the bloom\nof too-much-blood, the new mother tried to stop his hand. He dragged\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0her out into the yard, flogged her\nwith the usual branch. If it was magic in the wood, they never\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0said, but she began to change: her scar-ridged back, beneath his lashes, toughened to a rind; it split\nand crusted into bark. Her prone\nknees dug in the sandy ground and rooted, questing for water,\nas her work-grained fingers lengthened\ninto twigs. The tree, a lychee, he continued to curse as if it\nwere his wife, its useless, meagre\nfruit. Meanwhile the girl survived. Feathered in greyish ash,\nher face tucked in, a little gosling. He called her Mei Ming: No Name. She never learned to speak. Her life\nmaimed by her father\u2019s sorrow.\nFor grief is a powerful thing, even for objects never conceived.\nHe should have dropped her down\nthe well. Then at least he could forget. Sometimes when he set\nto work, hefting up his axe\nto watch the cleanness of its arc, she butted at his elbow, again, till angry, he flapped her from him. But if these silent pleas had\nmeaning, neither knew.\nThe child\u2019s only comfort came from nestling under the\nlychee tree. Its shifting branches\nwhistled her wordless lullabies: the lychees with their watchful eyes,\nthe wild geese crossing overhead.\nThe fruit, the geese. They marked her seasons. She didn\u2019t long to join\nthe birds, if longing implies a will beyond the blindest instinct. Then one mid-autumn, she craned\nher neck so far to mark the geese\nwheeling through the clouded hills, it kept on stretching, till\nit tapered in a beak. Her pink toes\nsprouted webs and claws; her helpless arms found strength\nin wings. The goose daughter\nsoared to join the arrowed skein: kin linked by a single aim\nand tide, she knew their heading and their need. They spent that year or more in flight, but where\nacross what sparkling tundral wastes,\nI\u2019ve not heard tell. Some say the fable ended there. But those\nwho know the ways of wild geese\nknow too the obligation to return, to their first dwelling place. Let this\nsuffice: late spring. A woodsman\nsnares a wild goose that spirals clean into his yard, almost like\nit knows. Gripping its sinewed neck he presses it down into the block, cross-hewn from a lychee trunk.\nA single blow. Profit, loss. \u00a0",

  "text": "When the television has stayed on too long, the channels\nended, and all the downstairs lights switched off but one,\nsometimes, rarely, my mother will begin to talk, without\nprelude or warning, about her growing up. Then her words\nfeel pulled up from a dark and unreflective well \u2014 willed and\nnot willed. It isn\u2019t that this tacit contract is not tinged by\nour same daily fumblings, but when the men are asleep, I\nthink she believes it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn to listen. Once she spoke of her horror, as a very small child, of the\ncommunal kitchen in their low-rise tenement \u2014 half-outdoors\nin that muggy climate, it ran across the whole row, a corridor\nor terrace; this space, aside from housing a blackened, static\nwok the size of a Western baby\u2019s bath, was also a latrine. Of\nsquatting barefoot over the cracked tile trench and trying\nnot to breathe. How despite themselves her eyes would follow\nto the nearby drain, as it sprouted; here she giggles, shivers\n\u2014 the glistening bodies of cockroaches, like obscene sucked sweets. I see them, the\ncolour of rust or shit, hitching up from the crusted grille on\nagile legs; things scuttling from some dank, subterranean chamber of\nthe head. * Another time she tells of being made, in the bucket room,\nat the place she always calls a school, to wash her hair with\na green detergent meant for scouring floors, shaken from a cardboard tube. Unconscious fingers reach\ntowards her scalp. I do not look for the candied rose-petal\npatches \u2014 there as long as I remember \u2014 as of mange or burns,\nthat tell why, before leaving her room, she will so carefully\nlayer and arrange her lovely black hair. * She tells these and other stories with a pause-pocked, melodic,\nstrangely dated hesitancy. What I mean by this is, whenever\nI hear it, that halting intonation takes me back to the years\nwhen we first moved here. In those days, in her early forties,\nin a new country, she spoke more slowly than now, and with\na subtle, near-constant nasal hum, more of a nnnnnng \u2014 so\nnatural to Cantonese but which filled the gaps between her otherwise fluent English\nlike the Thereminy strings in a Mandarin film score. As she\nchatted with the mothers of new friends, tentatively made\nand dropped-off to play, it seemed to me that every minute\nor so \u2014 I could feel it building \u2014 she would stick mid-note:\nraised hand stilled, chin tilted in the doorway, a wound-down\nmarionette I willed and willed to start up its song again. A\ntic the local children mocked me for \u2014 that nnnnnnnnnnng\nin the playground \u2014 as I tried not to be ashamed. * It thuds into my chest, this pendent\nring of milky jade \u2014\nI wear it strung on an old watch chain \u2014 meant for a baby\u2019s bracelet. Into its\nsmooth circlet\nI can \u2014 just \u2014 fit a quincunx of five fingertips. Cool on my palm it rests \u2014\nthe sinople eye\non a butterfly\u2019s wing. When I was born she took it across to Wong Tai Sin,\nmy mother\u2019s mother,\nto have it blessed. I saw that place \u2014 its joss-stick incensed mist, the fortunecasting\nherd,\ntheir fluttering, tree-tied pleas \u2014 only later as a tourist. As for the jade, I never wore\nor even saw it\nthen. The logic runs like this: if baby falls, the loop of stone \u2014 a sacrifice \u2014\nwill shatter\nin her place. Painfully knelt on the altar step, did the old woman shake out a sheath\nof red-tipped\nsticks, and pick one, to entreat my fate\u2014 And if I break it now \u2014 will I be saved?",

My favourite line was always her\nsidelong pickerel smile. It flashes across her face\nand my mind\u2019s current, that smile, as bright and fast\nand shy as the silvery juvenile fish, glimpsed,\nit vanishes, quick into murk and swaying weeds,\na kink of green and bubbles all that?s left behind. I was sure of this, the dead girl\u2019s vividness,\nher smile unseated, as by a stumbling stride,\ntill one rainy Cambridge evening, my umbrella\nbucking, I headed toward Magdalene to meet an\nold friend. We ducked under The Pickerel\u2019s\npainted sign, its coiled fish tilting; over a drink\nour talk fell to Roethke, his pickerel smile, and\nI had one of those blurrings, glitch, then focus\nlike at a put-off optician\u2019s trip, when you realise how long you\u2019ve been seeing things wrongly.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\u2019d never noticed: in every stanza after the first,\nJane is a bird: wren or sparrow, skittery pigeon.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wrong kind of pickerel! In my head, her\nsmile abruptly evolved: now the stretched beak\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0of a wading bird, a stint or purre,\u00a0 swung\ninto profile. I saw anew the diffident stilts\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0of the girl, her casting head, her gangly almost\ngrace, puttering away across a tarnished mirror of estuary mud. In Homer, the Sirens are winged\ncreatures: the Muses clipped them for their failure.\nBy the Renaissance, their feathers have switched\nfor a mermaid\u2019s scaly tail. In the emblem by Alciato\n(printed Padua, 1618) the woodcut pictures a pair\nof chicken-footed maids, promising mantric truths\nto a Ulysses slack at his mast. But the subscriptio\ndenounces women, contra naturam, plied with hindparts\nof fish: for lust brings with it many monsters. Or take how Horace begins the Ars Poetica,\nticking off poets who dare too much: mating savage\nwith tame, or snakes with birds, can only create such\nhorrors, he says, as a comely waist that winds up\nin a black and hideous fish. The pickerel-girl swims\nthrough my mind\u2019s eye\u2019s flummery like a game\nof perspectives, a corrugated picture: fish one way\nfowl the other. Could it be that Roethke meant\nthe word\u2019s strange double-ness,\u00a0 Neither father nor lover. A tutor watches a girl click-to the door\nof his study with reverent care, one winter evening,\nand understands Horace on reining in fantasy.",

I walk through darkness even though it is mid-afternoon. The stumpy trees cling to each other, the graves slant awkwardly like drunks. Here, nothing speaks or creaks or rustles. It is like being in a silent film, black/white, distorted by the dark green light that comes from I can\u2019t tell where. The only angel is sad-faced with scarred limbs, looking down as if heaven were mud at her feet. She is petrified, her head bowed, her hands wrung stonily together in prayer as if god had promised her the earth, pretending that this included the leaving of it. Sick, \u00a0 that sharp sting that brings me face to face with you, as if my veins briefly brought us back to life, back to memory which was not how it was supposed to be. The trees are closer than ever as if they had grown for a century and never been pruned back. Have we been sleeping for one hundred years?\u00a0 Faces float like moons: Mae Marsh, the girl with the bee stung lips, bee sting, gentle bee sting, blonde, beautiful, bee stung. Now the afternoon light is a shining halo of blonde then as the sun slips down the chorus line, Clara Bow, flaming youth personified, all auburn hair and scarlet smile bursts out dancing her frantic Charleston. \u00a0 Night, and we are alone. I touch her chipped neck, her verdigris eyelids, her weatherbeaten hands, her broken wings, wings of marble. She can barely tolerate their weight. I almost think she will speak to me for I have shown her kindness, but her lips are closed forever and underneath the stiff, white shift, her heart is broken. The gates of what could have been a low budget heaven are rusted shut, browning flowers entwined and crumbling. The script is torn and scattered, The stars are dead. I feel a rush of rain, then nothing. My eyelids are far too heavy to open. My back is bowed and my hands won\u2019t move. My face is an ugly, cracked blankness.",

After gods, we surrender to lovers,\nSeeking beauty that always satisfies,\nTo revel in sunlit obscenities,\nEvery gay April, in the spring tumult,\nTo engage in creamy crimes \u2014\nAn ivory music, as indestructible as sunlight. Something there is about April that satisfies \u2014\nEven if one suffer physical obscenities\nLike those that drive priests to tumult\nAnd exultation in the filthiest crimes,\nThose conducted far from sunlight\nIn those murky lairs reserved for lovers. But holy are the bedtime obscenities\nWhere lover pitches lover to a tumult,\nSpicing bland sins with sugary crimes,\nIn moonlight, dawn, and even April sunlight.\nThus, lovers actually behave like lovers,\nHaving each other until the other satisfies. Nature, in April, floods in tumult:\nIts white churn washes away crimes;\nIts clarity is like water and sunlight,\nThe ideal assemblage for real lovers,\nWho only turn away once love satisfies,\nOnce they have tasted joyous obscenities. In April, the young commit no crimes,\nBut are as clean and honest as sunlight,\nAnd love each other as blamelessly as lovers,\nDiscovering, like saints, the ways sin satisfies,\nExcusing each other of any obscenities,\nWhile each one milks a tidal tumult. What is the month of love and sunlight?\nAsk all those who play April lovers!\nFor thirty refreshing days, it satisfies,\nAll those poets of obscenities,\nWho find passion a physical tumult,\nAnd conceive kisses as delicious crimes. Tell all the lovers that April satisfies,\nThat its obscenities mount a glorious tumult,\nAnd that all its crimes dissolve to sunlight.",

  "text": "This poem is about the crime that sent George and Rufus Hamilton to the gallows in Fredericton, New Brunswick, July 27 1949. This poem is called \u2018The Killing\u2019 and in this poem I present the voices of Rufus, who is called \u2018Rue\u2019, spelled R-U-E, and of course George. The two brothers here reflecting on their crime. Rue:\u2002I ingratiated the grinning hammer\nwith Silver\u2019s not friendless, not unfriendly skull.\nBehind him like a piece of storm, I unleashed a frozen glinting\u2014\na lethal gash of lightning.\nHis soul leaked from him in a Red Sea, a Dead Sea,\nchurning his clothes to lava. Geo:\u2002No, it didn\u2019t look like real blood,\nbut something more like coal, that inched from his mouth. Rue:\u2002It was a cold hit in the head. A hurt unmassageable.\nCar seat left stinking of gas and metal and blood.\nAnd reddening violently.\nA rhymeless poetry scrawled his obituary. Geo:\u2002It was comin on us for awhile, this here misery.\nWe\u2019d all split a beer before iron split Silver\u2019s skull.\nSilver\u2019s muscles still soft and tender. That liquor killed him.\nThe blood like shadow on his face, his caved?in face.\nSmell of his blood over everything. Rue:\u2002Iron smell of the hammer mingled with iron smell of blood\nand chrome smell of snow and moonlight. Geo:\u2002He had two hundred dollars on him; bootleg in him.\nWe had a hammer on us, a spoonful of cold beer in us. The taxi?driver lies red in the alabaster snow.\nHis skeleton has taken sick and must be placed in the ground. This murder is 100 per cent dirt of our hands. Rue:\u2002Twitchy, my hand was twitchy, inside my jacket.\nThe hammer was gravity: everything else was jumpy.\nI wondered if Silver could hear his own blood thundering,\nvermilion, in his temples, quickened, twitchy, because of beer;\njumpy molecules infecting his corpuscles, already nervous. The hammer went in so far that there was no sound\u2014\njust the slight mushy squeak of bone.\nSilver swooned like the leaden Titanic.\nBlood screamed down his petit-bourgeois clothes.\nGeo: Can we cover up a murder with snow?\nWith white, frosty roses? Rue:\u2002Here\u2019s how I justify my error:\nThe blow that slew Silver came from two centuries back.\nIt took that much time and agony to turn a white man\u2019s whip\ninto a black man\u2019s hammer. Geo:\u2002No, we needed money,\nso you hit the So and So,\nonly much too hard.\nNow what? Rue:\u2002So what?",

  "author": "William Wordsworth",
  "text": "Five years have past; five summers, with the length Of five long winters! and again I hear These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs With a soft inland murmur.\u2014Once again Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs, That on a wild secluded scene impress Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect The landscape with the quiet of the sky. The day is come when I again repose Here, under this dark sycamore, and view These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts, Which at this season, with their unripe fruits, Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves \u2018Mid groves and copses. Once again I see These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms, Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke Sent up, in silence, from among the trees! With some uncertain notice, as might seem Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods, Or of some Hermit\u2019s cave, where by his fire The Hermit sits alone. \u00a0 These beauteous forms, Through a long absence, have not been to me As is a landscape to a blind man\u2019s eye: But oft, in lonely rooms, and \u2018mid the din Of towns and cities, I have owed to them, In hours of weariness, sensations sweet, Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart; And passing even into my purer mind With tranquil restoration:\u2014feelings too Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps, As have no slight or trivial influence On that best portion of a good man\u2019s life, His little, nameless, unremembered, acts Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust, To them I may have owed another gift, Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood, In which the burthen of the mystery, In which the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world, Is lightened:\u2014that serene and blessed mood, In which the affections gently lead us on,\u2014 Until, the breath of this corporeal frame And even the motion of our human blood Almost suspended, we are laid asleep In body, and become a living soul: While with an eye made quiet by the power Of harmony, and the deep power of joy, We see into the life of things. \u00a0 If this Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft\u2014 In darkness and amid the many shapes Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir Unprofitable, and the fever of the world, Have hung upon the beatings of my heart\u2014 How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee, O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro\u2019 the woods, How often has my spirit turned to thee! \u00a0 And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought, With many recognitions dim and faint, And somewhat of a sad perplexity, The picture of the mind revives again: While here I stand, not only with the sense Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts That in this moment there is life and food For future years. And so I dare to hope, Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first I came among these hills; when like a roe I bounded o\u2019er the mountains, by the sides Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams, Wherever nature led: more like a man Flying from something that he dreads, than one Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then (The coarser pleasures of my boyish days And their glad animal movements all gone by) To me was all in all.\u2014I cannot paint What then I was. The sounding cataract Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock, The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, Their colours and their forms, were then to me An appetite; a feeling and a love, That had no need of a remoter charm, By thought supplied, not any interest Unborrowed from the eye.\u2014That time is past, And all its aching joys are now no more, And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts Have followed; for such loss, I would believe, Abundant recompense. For I have learned To look on nature, not as in the hour Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes The still sad music of humanity, Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power To chasten and subdue.\u2014And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean and the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man: A motion and a spirit, that impels All thinking things, all objects of all thought, And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still A lover of the meadows and the woods And mountains; and of all that we behold From this green earth; of all the mighty world Of eye, and ear,\u2014both what they half create, And what perceive; well pleased to recognise In nature and the language of the sense The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse, The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul Of all my moral being. \u00a0 Nor perchance, If I were not thus taught, should I the more Suffer my genial spirits to decay: For thou art with me here upon the banks Of this fair river; thou my dearest Friend, My dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch The language of my former heart, and read My former pleasures in the shooting lights Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while May I behold in thee what I was once, My dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make, Knowing that Nature never did betray The heart that loved her; \u2019tis her privilege, Through all the years of this our life, to lead From joy to joy: for she can so inform The mind that is within us, so impress With quietness and beauty, and so feed With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues, Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men, Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all The dreary intercourse of daily life, Shall e\u2019er prevail against us, or disturb Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon Shine on thee in thy solitary walk; And let the misty mountain-winds be free To blow against thee: and, in after years, When these wild ecstasies shall be matured Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms, Thy memory be as a dwelling-place For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then, If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief, Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts Of tender joy wilt thou remember me, And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance\u2014 If I should be where I no more can hear Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams Of past existence\u2014wilt thou then forget That on the banks of this delightful stream We stood together; and that I, so long A worshipper of Nature, hither came Unwearied in that service: rather say With warmer love\u2014oh! with far deeper zeal Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget, That after many wanderings, many years Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs, And this green pastoral landscape, were to me More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!",

  "text": "1 When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom\u2019d, And the great star early droop\u2019d in the western sky in the night, I mourn\u2019d, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring. \u00a0 Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring, Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west, And thought of him I love. \u00a0 2 O powerful western fallen star! O shades of night\u2014O moody, tearful night! O great star disappear\u2019d\u2014O the black murk that hides the star! O cruel hands that hold me powerless\u2014O helpless soul of me! O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul. \u00a0 3 In the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash\u2019d palings, Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich green, With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong I love, With every leaf a miracle\u2014and from this bush in the dooryard, With delicate-color\u2019d blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green, A sprig with its flower I break. \u00a0 4 In the swamp in secluded recesses, A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song. \u00a0 Solitary the thrush, The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements, Sings by himself a song. \u00a0 Song of the bleeding throat, Death\u2019s outlet song of life, (for well dear brother I know, If thou wast not granted to sing thou would\u2019st surely die.) \u00a0 5 Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities, Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep\u2019d from the ground, spotting the gray debris, Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the endless grass, Passing the yellow-spear\u2019d wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprisen, Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards, Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave, Night and day journeys a coffin. \u00a0 6 Coffin that passes through lanes and streets, Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land, With the pomp of the inloop\u2019d flags with the cities draped in black, With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil\u2019d women standing, With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night, With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the unbared heads, With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces, With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn, With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour\u2019d around the coffin, The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs\u2014where amid these you journey, With the tolling tolling bells\u2019 perpetual clang, Here, coffin that slowly passes, I give you my sprig of lilac. \u00a0 7 (Nor for you, for one alone, Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring, For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you O sane and sacred death. \u00a0 All over bouquets of roses, O death, I cover you over with roses and early lilies, But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first, Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes, With loaded arms I come, pouring for you, For you and the coffins all of you O death.) \u00a0 8 O western orb sailing the heaven, Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walk\u2019d, As I walk\u2019d in silence the transparent shadowy night, As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night, As you droop\u2019d from the sky low down as if to my side, (while the other stars all look\u2019d on,) As we wander\u2019d together the solemn night, (for something I know not what kept me from sleep,) As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you were of woe, As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night, As I watch\u2019d where you pass\u2019d and was lost in the netherward black of the night, As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb, Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone. \u00a0 9 Sing on there in the swamp, O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your call, I hear, I come presently, I understand you, But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain\u2019d me, The star my departing comrade holds and detains me. \u00a0 10 O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved? And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone? And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love? \u00a0 Sea-winds blown from east and west, Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till there on the prairies meeting, These and with these and the breath of my chant, I\u2019ll perfume the grave of him I love. \u00a0 11 O what shall I hang on the chamber walls? And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls, To adorn the burial-house of him I love? \u00a0 Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes, With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright, With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air, With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific, In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and there, With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows, And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys, And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning. \u00a0 12 Lo, body and soul\u2014this land, My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the ships, The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light, Ohio\u2019s shores and flashing Missouri, And ever the far-spreading prairies cover\u2019d with grass and corn. \u00a0 Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty, The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes, The gentle soft-born measureless light, The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill\u2019d noon, The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars, Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land. \u00a0 13 Sing on, sing on you gray-brown bird, Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes, Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines. \u00a0 Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song, Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe. \u00a0 O liquid and free and tender! O wild and loose to my soul\u2014O wondrous singer! You only I hear\u2014yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart,) Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me. \u00a0 14 Now while I sat in the day and look\u2019d forth, In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and the farmers preparing their crops, In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests, In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb\u2019d winds and the storms,) Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and women, The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail\u2019d, And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labor, And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages, And the streets how their throbbings throbb\u2019d, and the cities pent\u2014lo, then and there, Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest, Appear\u2019d the cloud, appear\u2019d the long black trail, And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death. \u00a0 Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me, And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me, And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions, I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not, Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness, To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still. \u00a0 And the singer so shy to the rest receiv\u2019d me, The gray-brown bird I know receiv\u2019d us comrades three, And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love. \u00a0 From deep secluded recesses, From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still, Came the carol of the bird. \u00a0 And the charm of the carol rapt me, As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night, And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird. \u00a0 Come lovely and soothing death, Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving, In the day, in the night, to all, to each, Sooner or later delicate death. \u00a0 Prais\u2019d be the fathomless universe, For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious, And for love, sweet love\u2014but praise! praise! praise! For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death. \u00a0 Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet, Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome? Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all, I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly. \u00a0 Approach strong deliveress, When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead, Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee, Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death. \u00a0 From me to thee glad serenades, Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee, And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky are fitting, And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night. \u00a0 The night in silence under many a star, The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know, And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil\u2019d death, And the body gratefully nestling close to thee. \u00a0 Over the tree-tops I float thee a song, Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the prairies wide, Over the dense-pack\u2019d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways, I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death. \u00a0 15 To the tally of my soul, Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird, With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night. \u00a0 Loud in the pines and cedars dim, Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume, And I with my comrades there in the night. \u00a0 While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed, As to long panoramas of visions. \u00a0 And I saw askant the armies, I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags, Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc\u2019d with missiles I saw them, And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody, And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,) And the staffs all splinter\u2019d and broken. \u00a0 I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them, And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them, I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war, But I saw they were not as was thought, They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer\u2019d not, The living remain\u2019d and suffer\u2019d, the mother suffer\u2019d, And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer\u2019d, And the armies that remain\u2019d suffer\u2019d. \u00a0 16 Passing the visions, passing the night, Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades\u2019 hands, Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul, Victorious song, death\u2019s outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song, As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night, Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy, Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven, As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses, Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves, I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring. \u00a0 I cease from my song for thee, From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee, O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night. \u00a0 Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night, The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird, And the tallying chant, the echo arous\u2019d in my soul, With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe, With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird, Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for the dead I loved so well, For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands\u2014and this for his dear sake, Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul, There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.",

  "text": "1 I celebrate myself, and sing myself, And what I assume you shall assume, For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you. \u00a0 I loafe and invite my soul, I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass. \u00a0 My tongue, every atom of my blood, form\u2019d from this soil, this air, Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same, I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin, Hoping to cease not till death. \u00a0 Creeds and schools in abeyance, Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten, I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard, Nature without check with original energy. \u00a0 2 Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with perfumes, I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it, The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it. \u00a0 The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is odorless, It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it, I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked, I am mad for it to be in contact with me. \u00a0 The smoke of my own breath, Echoes, ripples, buzz\u2019d whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine, My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs, The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color\u2019d sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn, The sound of the belch\u2019d words of my voice loos\u2019d to the eddies of the wind, A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms, The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag, The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides, The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun. \u00a0 Have you reckon\u2019d a thousand acres much? have you reckon\u2019d the earth much? Have you practis\u2019d so long to learn to read? Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems? \u00a0 Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems, You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,) You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books, You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me, You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self. \u00a0 3 I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the end, But I do not talk of the beginning or the end. \u00a0 There was never any more inception than there is now, Nor any more youth or age than there is now, And will never be any more perfection than there is now, Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now. \u00a0 Urge and urge and urge, Always the procreant urge of the world. \u00a0 Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex, Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life. \u00a0 To elaborate is no avail, learn\u2019d and unlearn\u2019d feel that it is so. \u00a0 Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the beams, Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical, I and this mystery here we stand. \u00a0 Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul. \u00a0 Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen, Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn. \u00a0 Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age, Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself. \u00a0 Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean, Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest. \u00a0 I am satisfied\u2014I see, dance, laugh, sing; As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread, Leaving me baskets cover\u2019d with white towels swelling the house with their plenty, Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes, That they turn from gazing after and down the road, And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent, Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead? \u00a0 4 Trippers and askers surround me, People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in, or the nation, The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new, My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues, The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love, The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations, Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful events; These come to me days and nights and go from me again, But they are not the Me myself. \u00a0 Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am, Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary, Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest, Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next, Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it. \u00a0 Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders, I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait. \u00a0 5 I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you, And you must not be abased to the other. \u00a0 Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat, Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best, Only the lull I like, the hum of your valv\u2019d voice. \u00a0 I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning, How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn\u2019d over upon me, And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart, And reach\u2019d till you felt my beard, and reach\u2019d till you held my feet. \u00a0 Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth, And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own, And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own, And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers, And that a kelson of the creation is love, And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields, And brown ants in the little wells beneath them, And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap\u2019d stones, elder, mullein and poke-weed. \u00a0 6 A child said\u00a0What is the grass?\u00a0fetching it to me with full hands; How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he. \u00a0 I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven. \u00a0 Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord, A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt, Bearing the owner\u2019s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say\u00a0Whose? \u00a0 Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation. \u00a0 Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic, And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones, Growing among black folks as among white, Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same. \u00a0 And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves. \u00a0 Tenderly will I use you curling grass, It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men, It may be if I had known them I would have loved them, It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers\u2019 laps, And here you are the mothers\u2019 laps. \u00a0 This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers, Darker than the colorless beards of old men, Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths. \u00a0 O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues, And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing. \u00a0 I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women, And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps. \u00a0 What do you think has become of the young and old men? And what do you think has become of the women and children? \u00a0 They are alive and well somewhere, The smallest sprout shows there is really no death, And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it, And ceas\u2019d the moment life appear\u2019d. \u00a0 All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses, And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.",

Vain man, said she, that doest in vain assay, A mortal thing so to immortalize, For I myself shall like to this decay, And eek my name be wiped out likewise. Not so, (quod I) let baser things devise To die in dust, but you shall live by fame: My verse, your virtues rare shall eternize, And in the heavens write your glorious name. Where whenas death shall all the world subdue, Our love shall live, and later life renew.",

  "text": "i A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine, Y cladd in mightie armes and silver shielde, Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine, The cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde; Yet armes till that time did he never wield: His angry steede did chide his foming bitt, As much disdayning to the curbe to yield: Full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt, As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt. \u00a0 ii But on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore, The deare remembrance of his dying Lord, For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore, And dead as living ever him ador\u2019d: Upon his shield the like was also scor\u2019d, For soveraine hope, which in his helpe he had: Right faithfull true he was in deede and word, But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad; Yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad. \u00a0 iii Upon a great adventure he was bond, That greatest Gloriana to him gave, That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond, To winne him worship, and her grace to have, Which of all earthly things he most did crave; And ever as he rode, his hart did earne To prove his puissance in battell brave Upon his foe, and his new force to learne; Upon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne. \u00a0 iv A lovely Ladie rode him faire beside, Upon a lowly Asse more white then snow, Yet she much whiter, but the same did hide Under a vele, that wimpled was full low, And over all a blacke stole she did throw, As one that inly mournd: so was she sad, And heavie sat upon her palfrey slow; Seemed in heart some hidden care she had, And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad. \u00a0 v So pure an innocent, as that same lambe, She was in life and every vertuous lore, And by descent from Royall lynage came Of ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore, And all the world in their subjection held; Till that infernall feend with foule uprore Forwasted all their land, and them expeld: Whom to avenge, she had this Knight from far compeld. \u00a0 vi Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag, That lasie seemd in being ever last, Or wearied with bearing of her bag Of needments at his backe. Thus as they past, The day with cloudes was suddeine overcast, And angry Jove an hideous storme of raine Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast, That every wight to shrowd it did constrain, And this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were fain. \u00a0 vii Enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand, A shadie grove not far away they spide, That promist ayde the tempest to withstand: Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride, Did spred so broad, that heavens light did hide, Not perceable with power of any starre: And all within were pathes and alleies wide, With footing worne, and leading inward farre: Faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre. \u00a0 viii And foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led, Joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony, Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred, Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky. Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy, The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall, The vine-prop Elme, the Poplar never dry, The builder Oake, sole king of forrests all, The Aspine good for staves, the Cypresse funerall. \u00a0 ix The Laurell, meed of mightie Conquerours And Poets sage, the Firre that weepeth still, The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours, The Eugh obedient to the benders will, The Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the mill, The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound, The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill, The fruitfull Olive, and the Platane round, The carver Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound. \u00a0 x Led with delight, they thus beguile the way, Untill the blustring storme is overblowne; When weening to returne, whence they did stray, They cannot find that path, which first was showne, But wander too and fro in wayes unknowne, Furthest from end then, when they neerest weene, That makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne: So many pathes, so many turnings seene, That which of them to take, in diverse doubt they been. \u00a0",

  "text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore\u2014 While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. \u201c\u2019Tis some visitor,\u201d I muttered, \u201ctapping at my chamber door\u2014 Only this and nothing more.\u201d \u00a0 Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow;\u2014vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow\u2014sorrow for the lost Lenore\u2014 For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore\u2014 Nameless\u00a0here\u00a0for evermore. \u00a0 And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me\u2014filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating \u201c\u2019Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door\u2014 Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;\u2014 This it is and nothing more.\u201d \u00a0 Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, \u201cSir,\u201d said I, \u201cor Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you\u201d\u2014here I opened wide the door;\u2014 Darkness there and nothing more. \u00a0 Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \u201cLenore?\u201d This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \u201cLenore!\u201d\u2014 Merely this and nothing more. \u00a0 Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. \u201cSurely,\u201d said I, \u201csurely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore\u2014 Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;\u2014 \u2019Tis the wind and nothing more!\u201d \u00a0 Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door\u2014 Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door\u2014 Perched, and sat, and nothing more. \u00a0 Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, \u201cThough thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\u201d I said, \u201cart sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore\u2014 Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night\u2019s Plutonian shore!\u201d Quoth the Raven \u201cNevermore.\u201d \u00a0 Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning\u2014little relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door\u2014 Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as \u201cNevermore.\u201d \u00a0 But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing farther then he uttered\u2014not a feather then he fluttered\u2014 Till I scarcely more than muttered \u201cOther friends have flown before\u2014 On the morrow\u00a0he\u00a0will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.\u201d Then the bird said \u201cNevermore.\u201d \u00a0 Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, \u201cDoubtless,\u201d said I, \u201cwhat it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore\u2014 Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of \u2018Never\u2014nevermore\u2019.\u201d \u00a0 But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore\u2014 What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking \u201cNevermore.\u201d \u00a0 This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom\u2019s core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion\u2019s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o\u2019er, But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o\u2019er, She\u00a0shall press, ah, nevermore! \u00a0 Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. \u201cWretch,\u201d I cried, \u201cthy God hath lent thee\u2014by these angels he hath sent thee Respite\u2014respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore; Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!\u201d Quoth the Raven \u201cNevermore.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cProphet!\u201d said I, \u201cthing of evil!\u2014prophet still, if bird or devil!\u2014 Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted\u2014 On this home by Horror haunted\u2014tell me truly, I implore\u2014 Is there\u2014is\u00a0there balm in Gilead?\u2014tell me\u2014tell me, I implore!\u201d Quoth the Raven \u201cNevermore.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cProphet!\u201d said I, \u201cthing of evil!\u2014prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us\u2014by that God we both adore\u2014 Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore\u2014 Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\u201d Quoth the Raven \u201cNevermore.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cBe that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\u201d I shrieked, upstarting\u2014 \u201cGet thee back into the tempest and the Night\u2019s Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken!\u2014quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\u201d Quoth the Raven \u201cNevermore.\u201d \u00a0 And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting,\u00a0still\u00a0is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon\u2019s that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o\u2019er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted\u2014nevermore! \u00a0",

  "text": "\u2018Ballad of a Hanged Man\u2019 is a poem which is written in the style of a song. It is based on fifteen hundred pages of trial testimony connected to the trial, conviction and execution of my first cousin once removed, George Hamilton, who was hanged along with his brother Rufus in Fredericton, New Brunswick, on July 27 1949, as a result of the murder and robbery that they committed in January 1949. Geo: Their drinks to my drinks feel different.\nI\u2019ll stomach a stammering teaspoon full,\nbut Roach laps up half the half bottle.\nHe slups glass for glass with the best. I sidled in, easy, the taxi with a hammer,\nharsh, in my pocket. See, as a wed man,\nI don\u2019t care if I wear uglified overalls.\nBut I ain\u2019t gonna hear my child starve. I had the intention to ruck some money.\nIn my own heart, I had that, to rape money,\nbecause I was fucked, in my own heart.\nI took scared, shaking inside of me. I knows Fredericton reporters can prove\nzoot-suit vines style not my viciousness.\nI was shaking all that evening, my mind,\nshaking. But my child was hungered. Have you ever gone in your life, going\ntwo days without eating, and whenever\nyou get money, you\u2019re gonna eat and eat\nregardless of all the bastards in Fredericton was bust in the head, skull jimmied open?\nThis is what I\u2019m sermonizing in English:\nhomemade brew, dug up fresh, tastes like\nmolasses. We had some. Some good. Logic does not break down these things, sir.\nIf I hadn\u2019t dropped the hammer, laughing,\nSilver would be laughing now. Laughing. Silver\nmoon and snow dropped on the ground. Two pieces of bone driven two inches\ndeep in his brain. What\u2019s deeper still?\nThe bones of the skull were bashed\ninto the brain. Blood railed out. I was so mixed up, my mind bent crooked.\nSilver\u2019s neck, face, and hand bleached cold.\nInside the sedan 19-black-49 sobbing Ford.\nOutside, snow and ice smelling red-stained. I ain\u2019t dressed this story up. I am enough\ndisgraced. I swear to the truths I know.\nI wanted to uphold my wife and child.\nHang me and I\u2019ll not hold them again.",

  "text": "Earth   A woman walks through a field of tall, green stalks and leaves a narrow trail of grass-gap as she goes. She has reached the trees, and is starting to climb towards the ridge.\u00a0 Her miseries are slippery and roll off her down the slope behind,\u00a0 but oblivion is not to be paced out on this earth, not while there is only the usual muddle under her shoes: of pebble, sand, clay, the different grains.   Air  No room is empty, no: it is divided by darknesses and light and full of that stuff we might breathe if we were there, and in which floats dust, mites, essences of floorboard and plaster, flakes of skin and hair belonging to me which you could snuff right in if you flared your nostrils like that and just inhaled.    Fire  A man who eats fire comes to understand monochrome. He touches dark-haired women, walks the cliff at night, searches for the gaps left by falling stars and muddies whatever colours are left.\u00a0 When you roll a sunflower towards him or suggest he bites into that tasty red sun making summer arches behind the crashed aeroplane, nothing flickers.   Water  So water is geometry, the waves oozing little triangles and folding like old carpets.\u00a0 So there?s an earth sea, made of furrows and cracked clay; a wood sea made of bark and sticks; a stone sea made of split flint and light.\u00a0 But when the river enters my bedroom complete with little steamer and gangplank I borrow pools of water, to water the floorboards that bring forth trees.

Left in peace, for long afternoons\nhe\u2019d cling around folds of the heifer\u2019s neck;\nwhisper an echo in the beast\u2019s dark ear,\nher big eyes and soft rough muzzle would turn to him.\nSlow-motion slavers and heavy breath fell across his face To those who listen the farmer\u2019s wife still recalls\nfinding him asleep in the grass \u2013 a smile within the herd;\nhis head resting on thick-hared warmth,\nlulled by the rise and fall of maternal ribs,\nthe beat of a larger heart.",

You strip me bare assed, turn me on my side shove a fan in my hand smearing fingers on thigh pout my lips below an almond eye and silhouette me in smouldering ochre.  I move just a little in this putrid breeze hair heavy to fuscous knees, still I\u2019m the pulse on the arm of this wall and I\u2019ve drawn her to me again.  Here she comes.  Not liking that she likes me not liking you, but knowing that she likes me, not liking you liking me, but she likes me and sees me, but not you, because you Gauguin, piss us off.  ",

The religion of his father was once the religion of the indigenous natives, but they had rejected and overthrown it.  And the son was yet seen as of that tribe which corroded the native culture and language.  An outsider, he felt at home with the art and culture of other outsiders, for many years he found companionship across space and time.  But from within he came to realise himself as instance of the universal human. The universal human is inclusive and absolute, there is no individual outside it.  This sense of the universal human is the home of all those who have won through to become themselves.  And much trouble in the world is caused by those who remain self-sequestered in their perceived province of the exclusive.",

We breathe\n\u2018Bonsoir\u2019 to each other \u2013 a bovine snuffle; nothing to ruffle the arrangements of bodies\ncomposed at the bar. Two men give a slight angling of the head. Yes, that more than any nod.\nThere is no one piloting the bar, till le patron steps up from the glare of the silent restaurant.\nToday is one of his unshaven days. He is small and must reach over the bar to shake my hand.\n\u2018Bonsoir, monsieur. Ca va? Bien?\u2019 \u2018Tr\u00e9s bien,\u2019 I reply and the slight puff of our enthusiasm\nrises with the cigarette smoke and disappears. He pours me a glass of beer slowly, ensuring\nbody and head are in proportion, and places it on a beer mat before me. He fills the glasses\nof the other men. And that\u2019s it. I stand at the bar and stare straight ahead or at the uncertain heap\nof coins and keys beside the coffee machine. Sometimes, talk is thin with them too and one\nby one they lapse into silence. Or there is a joke at someone\u2019s expense or a flurry of attitude \u2013\na dismaying eruption of conviction. This is one of the things I do well and I do not say it\nlightly. I have learnt, over many years, to hold myself within my stall, as if standing here alone\nis all I need. Because of this, I can stand with others and let them be alone too. But what\nmakes possible this solitary act is that all this time I breathe with them and give them what breath\nI have.

They sit composed now, slightly slumped,\nsculpted by the kitchen light, as the moon\ngives shape to the olive trees, the stones\nin the fields, the fallen almonds. They are a family,\nonce all activity has been stripped from them.\nAnd they sit, mostly in silence, sifting through\nthis air, this love, the faintest scent of thyme.",

  "text": "On the first ever day of spring, Caravaggio\nstrolls over the old stone bridge to market. There, he orders three pounds of pippins,\ntwo of red delicious, one each of bananas and of pears. His eye tells him what\u2019s ripe,\nwhat\u2019s sweet, crisp or tart. Lastly, he points to a large bunch of inky-blue grapes. Per favore\n\u201cNice ones these,\u201d remarks the vendor \u2013 a tiny lady in a black Bulls cap with one\nwinking gold tooth. She\u2019s noticed how taken her customer is with the grapes.\nCaravaggio thinks he\u2019ll paint them later, include them in his knowing Little Bacchus \u2013\nthat sallow-skinned portrait of his self. He is twenty or so \u2013 fresh from the country \u2013\nand what he feels this warming morning standing before these piled fruit stalls\nis not innocence but wide-eyed appetite \u2013 an openness to all fecundity. History\nwill call him stormy petrel, tempestuous, libidinous; temper as much as fever\nwill eventually kill him. But this morning all that feels so unlikely; impossible even,\nas he heads for home, cradling his five bags of fruit. At the bridge head, one of a pair of swans,\ncircling its young, raises itself from the river and lifts up its wings. A slab of white light\nhits Caravaggio with a shock of pleasure like a lover\u2019s open thigh, a magnificence\nthat folds in on itself, as indeed light folds into darkness. A lesson his eye takes in\nbefore he returns across the sparkling waters.",

But beyond it all, the voices of our loved ones called so we flowed through borders like the wind through railings \u00a0 and when impassable mountains marked the way, soared above their peaks like flocks of cloud, like shoals of rain. In time the fields and woods grew weary and the sea began \u2013 you could tell we were home by the way our shadows leaned. \u00a0 We gathered like craneflies in the windowlight of familiar rooms, grieving for all the things we could never hold again.

Light suspends it, blinds me as I again unpack the shadows. Who would have gone with him? In order to descend that never ending staircase and pass through the smallest crevice he planed his limbs so they could be closer to me at every moment. He shed beauty like a snake, skinned his retina so no pleasure could take root. Infra- thin rouge on lips was all that told me he was there. That and his suitcase\u2026 an album with his latest songs perhaps or space for me \u2026 It was touching if I could still be touched. But I was an idea now and when he turned to me, wrapped in his coat, it was just to share the thought that two blue thread floating from his sleeve could help him measure chance. What was he thinking? I turned away, back into the diagram of caverns.  Still, I see that head in my mind\u2019s eye, like a bicycle wheel attached to a stool spinning out the same song, same thread, same net. I raise up my arms and slip nothing on. ",

He read the paper, started the crossword, poked at the black pudding with his fork. Then he stared through the window for long, unbroken minutes at a time, but only at the busy road, never the sky.

And so I see the scene again: late afternoon; the little minister, still svelte but on the verge of portliness, breasting the ice with a frank and open stroke;  his friends, the painters, smiling, betting: which one could lay down just that shade of lilac shadow cast by the suburban Mercury, silhouetted contre jour?  Then, the sudden hush as water tensed at his instruction, trout gazed up at his incisive feet. I felt that God must be in clarity like this and listened to the valley echo  the striations of his silver blades. Far out on Duddingston Loch our true apostle sped with twice the speed of Christ who walked on waves.  I saw him harrow ice with grace of the elect and scar the transubstantiation of wintered elements. At once I heard a tapping from the hills  as if a tiny hammer big with work sought to split this world: the shelf of ice with all its merry skaters cracked from side to side then tipped  like a sinking ship; loch made meadow loch as little cows, aristocratic blades, the Reverend and his painters clung to trees  above a sundered castle, floated off to villages, new towns, enlightened schemes and sunken moonlit pastures. With a sense of real presence  he crossed my vision: and I wondered if it mattered which man would win the bet: Raeburn or Danloux?  Both helped him to untie the fine pink inkles strapping blade to boot and walked away with him  arm in arm towards the village. ",

All that remained was a single Scottish word bewildered by the Paris winter frost and the lights of its riverbank motorways. What can dustie-fute have to say to a night like this? How can it dangle on its hyphen down into the rue Geoffro L\u2019Ansier where Danton stayed on the eve of revolution? How can it tame this strangeness for me or change me into the cupolas and flagstones I so desire yet still notice every time I walk among them? Does the \u2018auld alliance\u2019 of words and things stand a chance among the traffic and pimps in the Publicis Saint-Germain? For its not as if dustie-fute were my familiar. I could easily confuse dustie-fute with elfmill which is the sound made by a worm in the timber of a house, supposed by the vulgar to be preternatural. These words are as foreign as the city they have parachuted into, dead words slipping on the sill of a living metropolis. They are extremes that touch like dangerous wires and the only hope for them, for us, is the space they inhabit, a room veering between dilettantism and dynamite. Old Scots words, big French city and in between absymal me: ane merchand or creamer, quha hes no certain dwelling place, quhair the dust may be dicht fra hes feete or schone. Dustie-fute, a stranger, equivalent to fairandman, at a loss in the empty of soul of his ancestors\u2019 beautiful langage and in the soulless city of his compeers living the 21st century now and scoffinf at his medieval wares. Yet here, precisely here, is their rendez-vous and triumphantly, stuffed down his sock, an oblique sense, the dustie-fute of \u2018revelry\u2019, the acrobat, the juggler who accompanies the toe-belled jongleur with his merchant\u2019s comic fairground face. He reaches deep into his base latinity, into his pede-pulverosi and French descendants pull our their own pieds poudreux. Dustie-fute remembers previous lives amid the plate glass of Les Halles. They magnify his motley, his midi-oranges, his hawker lyrics and for a second Beaubourg words graze Scottish glass then glance apart. In this revelry differences copulate, become more visible and bearable and, stranger than the words or the city I inhabit, I reach for my yoghurt and find it there.",

  "text": "Tarred roads, metal cattle-grids and wheel tracks mesh so tightly no land can escape. Tractor ruts cut deep into the grass to cross and double-stitch the fields together. Where the high ground pushes upwards, pylons rigid with electricity stand guard upon the hills. Bridges staple running water, lines of fence-posts nail the valley sides in place. \u00a0 Rain and ploughed mud. Rooks\u2019 cries claw the air, a banshee trapped in corrugated iron shrieks to be released. Trees grasp at nothing, and let go. It is a scene a child has painted, splashing colours on sodden paper: his carelessness might tear a mountainside apart. \u00a0 Shingle being ground to nothing on the river-bed, the clouds\u2019 silence soaking into the hills \u2013 these are secrets I dare not tell even to myself. They give weight to every moment of my life.",

  "text": "My grandfather dreamt he was trying hard to die and no one would help him. He dreamt he went walking across Flanders field, and he saw the companies of dead men whose screaming he still hears night after night. \u00a0 The countryside was a woman dressed in red. He saw her courted briefly by a million men carrying bayonets and mortars \u2013 her face turning towards his, turned his to stone and made the white clouds whirl dizzily overhead. \u00a0 My grandfather dreamt that he was six years old and a woman decked in flowers or blood was guiding him to Flanders field \u2013 \u00a0 he saw ungathered poppies scattered on the floor, and the ceiling tilting crazily, and the lights swaying. Shadows tumbling out of the darkness beckoned him everywhere. \u00a0 He saw her heaping flowers into a bed. Then one by one she took the shadows to lie with her, and one by one he saw them disappear.",

Thus with wire-wrought baskets we voyaged, and some with trolleys, back wheels flipping like trout tails, cruised the narrow canyons twixt cascading shelves, the prow of our journeying cleaving stale air. Legion were the items that came tamely to hand: five stainless steel teaspoons, ten corn-relief plasters, the busy bear pedal bin liners fragranced with country lavender, the Disney design calendar and diary set, three cans of Vimto, cornucopia of potato-based snacks and balm for a sweet tooth, toys and games, goods of Orient made, and of Cathay, all under the clouded eye of CCTV, beyond the hazard cone where serious chutney spillage had occurred. Then emerged souls: the duty manager with a face like Doncaster, mumbling, \u201cFor so much, what shall we give in return?\u201d The blood-stained employee of the month, sobbing on a woolsack of fun-fur rugs, many uniformed servers, spectral, drifting between aisles. Then came Elpenor, our old friend Elpenor, slumped and shrunken by the Seasonal Products display. In strangled words I managed: \u201cHow art thou come to these shady channels, into hell\u2019s ravine?\u201d And he: \u201cTo loan sharks I owe the bone and marrow of my all.\u201d Then Walt Whitman, enquiring politely of the delivery boy. And from Special Occasions came forth Tiresias, dead in life, alive in death, cider-scented and sock-less, Oxfam-clad, shaving cuts to both cheeks. And my own mother reaching out, slipping a tin of stewing steak to the skirt pocket of her wedding dress, blessed with a magician\u2019s touch, practiced in need. \u00a0 But never until the valley widened at the gated brink did we open our lips to fish out those corn-coloured coins, those minted obols, hard won tokens graced with our monarch\u2019s head, kept hidden beneath the tongue\u2019s eel, blood-tasting, both ornament and safeguard, of armour made. And paid forthwith, then broke surface \u00a0 \u00a0 and breathed extraordinary daylight into starved lungs, steered for home through precincts and parks scalded by polar winds, ladened with whatnot, lightened of golden quids. \u00a0",

I have a brain the size of a basketball, and on that basis alone am entitled to my opinions. I am a sperm whale. When I breathe in, the fluid in my head cools to a dense wax and I nosedive into the depths. My song, available on audiocassette and compact disc is a comfort to divorcees, astrologists and those who have \u2018pitched the quavering canvas tent of their thoughts on the rim of the dark crater\u2019. The oil in my head is of huge commercial value and has been used by NASA, for even in the galactic emptiness of deep space it does not freeze. I am attracted to the policies of the Green Party on paper but once inside the voting booth my hand is guided by an unseen force. Sometimes I vomit large chunks of ambergris. My brother, Jeff, owns a camping and outdoor clothing shop in the Lake District and is a recreational user of cannabis. Customers who bought books about me also bought Do Whales Have Belly Buttons? by Melvin Berger and street maps of Cardiff. In many ways I have seen it all. I keep no pets. Lying motionless on the surface I am said to be \u2018logging\u2019, and \u2018lobtailing\u2019 when I turn and offer my great slow fluke to the horizon. Don\u2019t be taken in by the dolphins and their winning smiles, they are the pickpockets of the ocean, the gypsy children of the open waters and they are laughing all the way to Atlantis. On the basis of \u2018finders keepers\u2019 I believe the Elgin Marbles should remain the property of the British Crown. I am my own God \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t I be? The first people to open me up thought my head was full of sperm, but they were men, and had lived without women for many weeks, and were far from home. Stuff comes blurting out. \u00a0",

He\u2019s crying for the people\nWho greet this day with dread\nBecause somebody dear to them\nIs far away or dead, For all the men and women\nWhose love affairs went wrong,\nWho try their best at merriment\nWhen Christmas comes along, For separated parents\nWhose turn it is to grieve\nWhile children hang their stockings up\nElsewhere on Christmas Eve, For everyone whose burden,\nCarried through the year,\nIs heavier at Christmastime,\nThe season of good cheer. That\u2019s why the baby\u2019s crying\nThere in the cattle stall:\nHe\u2019s crying for those people.\nHe\u2019s crying for them all.",

  "text": "By noon your breathing had changed from normal to shallow and panicky. That\u2019s when the nurse said Nearly there now, in the gentle voice of a parent comforting a child used to failure, slipping her arms beneath your shoulders to hoist your up the pillows, then pressing a startling gauze pad under your jaw. \u00a0 Nearly there now. The whole world seemed to agree \u2013 as the late April sky deepened through the afternoon into high August blue, the vapour trails of two planes converged to sketch a cross on the brow of heaven. My brother Kit and I kept our backs turned to that except now and again. It was the room I wanted to see, \u00a0 because it contained your last example of everything: the broken metal window-catch that meant no fresh air; your toothbrush standing to attentiopn in its plastic mug; the neutral pink walls flushed into definite pale red by sunlight rejoicing in the flowering cherry outside; your dressing gown like a stranger within the wardrobe \u00a0 eavesdropping. That should have been a sign to warn us, but unhappiness made us brave, or do I mean cowardly, and Kit and I talked as if we were already quite certain you could no longer hear us, saying how easy you were to love, but how difficult always to satisfy and relax \u2013 how impossible to talk to, in fact, how expert with silence. \u00a0 You breathed more easily but the time we were done, although the thought you might have heard us after all, and our words be settling into your soft brain like stones onto the bed of a stream \u2013 that made our own breathing tighter. Then the nurse looked in: Nothing will change here for a while boys, and we ducked out like criminals. \u00a0 I was ordering two large gins in the pub half a mile off when my mobile rang. It was the hospital. You had died. I put my drink down, then thought again and finished it. Five minutes later we were back at the door of your room wondering whether to knock. Would everything we said be written on your face, like the white cross on the heavens? \u00a0 Of course not. It was written in us, where no one could find it except ourselves. Your own face was wiped entirely clean \u2013 and so, with your particular worried solved, and your sadness, I could see more clearly than ever how like mine it was, and therefore how my head will eventually look on the pillow when the wall opens behind me, and I depart with my failings.",

They were fit and strong.\nEach morning early they would sprint along\nThe hundred yards of poolside, stretch and bend,\nDo press-ups, then dive in at the deep end.\nTheir skin was like cracked leather; it was slung\nRoughly across their bones, their muscles strung\nIn loose alliance, waiting to disband.\nOr so it seems in retrospect. I\u2019m told\nThat one bleak New Year\u2019s morning with no moon,\nWhen boys like me were sleeping, the old men\nCracked a stiff film of ice across the bath,\nThen lined up at the edge to plunge beneath\nInto the darkness and the silent cold.",

  "text": "On the beach in sudden sunshine, her turn: Write down, she said\u00a0the first word you think of, we\u2019ll launch it in the bottle. And what they sent out was\u00a0irretrievable. Meanwhile, a wave had carried their footwear away, which they had left while paddling. Out to sea, round the Point, past the Basalt Caves, the tide carried all four examples and the bottle with them. That lasted much longer than the footwear, which the sea soon bedraggled. Pretty well screwed up, so to speak, the bottle stayed in one piece and was watertight, it was one of several environmental flaws deplored by persons on the deck of a boat circling round an offshore windfarm; the fisherman guide, running trips to see the seals on a famous sandbank would have seen it too, and maintained his silence. It floated on past a hinterland where first there appeared a bright and perilous resort from which a rail link went out passing many fields of oilseed rape, and horses freed of their blankets of summer until, with long moss-greened commuter platforms, a city kicked in with capital\u2019s anonymous glass megaliths. In one of those, an icon guaranteed the manufacture of many billions of similar bottles never to have a mission like this one\u2019s . . . For weeks and weeks it didn\u2019t make the shore, unlike the bodies of two of the locally drowned and one of the murdered . . . But at last a current coaxed it into a lagoon where it finally ended just inland on the purple verge of a saltmarsh. His writing had been large, with a felt-tip pen, in black, on good notepad paper, and although the sun had faded it, the word was still clear,\u00a0irretrievable, when an inquisitive hand unscrewed the cap\u00a0\u2013 not easy\u00a0\u2013 and fingered it out. To be standing there in a marsh in the onset of even a small contradiction dis- composed him: he had retrieved both the bottle and the old assumption that led him to think it must be a letter inside it. The bottle, now an irrelevant messenger, he dismissed at once, but what you might call the \u201cmessage\u201d he kept. Against the odds, it raised his confidence, if at moments he was disposed to shiver and wonder whether he should just let it go. But he did not do that, it was still in his pocket on the day the two lovers failed again to sense the treachery of the tide and he, having read that one extempore word, was at last tracked down to \u201cthis beautiful lonely stretch of the Oyster Coast.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0",

Then the truck arrived with its grey bridal train of dust\nOn the straight itself, ten seconds up ahead.\nI stood still on the only ledge above\nA deep green drop that might have checked a fall, And raised a hand, smiling, to a windscreen where\nAnother hand raised itself, someone smiling back\nAcknowledging me, and leaving me again\nLooking down alone through a settling cloud At the shuddering cargo of logs that had been trees,\nEach longer than the length of the truck itself;\nAt the end of the very largest, no white- or red-\nOr any-coloured rag to warn about what it carried. \u00a0",

But my finger pauses an inch\nAway from the button because I\u2019ve remembered something.\nI\u2019ve remembered my daily journey to that school\nIn the late nineteen-fifties, with that colleague In the same eight-seat compartment, smog-stained windows,\nSoiled upholstery, seaside pictures, Elmers End,\nEden Park, West Wickham, Hayes. All the time,\nMy companion, the cynical music master,\nWould drone and hum and smile and apologise \u2013 Lesson preparation. The suburban landscape\nWould modulate through Macmillan\u2019s constituency\nFrom inner to outer, and \u2018You could call that\u00a0countryside,\nFor a yard or two,\u2019 he\u2019s say. And throughout one week,\nWhen we had the Parents\u2019 Evening on the Friday, Having sung at Glyndebourne, and being capable\nOf presenting himself as a decent tenore robusto,\nHe practised Tosti\u2019s ballad for the Parents,\nIts fusian intro, its maudlin vocal acrobatics . . .\nThe windows rattled on their leather straps. Scrubland with never-inhabited workshop ruins.\nGolf-course with flags in holes on pallid greens.\n\u2013 He practised for the Parents as it all went by,\n\u2018And who\u00a0cares! Honestly, Brownjohn, who fucking\u00a0cares!\u2019\nHe would say, with the formality of the age. At Elmers End, if I\u2019m right, on the Friday morning,\nWith \u2018another day opening its squalid legs\nFor us to squander ourselves in\u2019, he got out,\nAnd \u2018not to ruin your entire bloody journey\u2019, he\nClimbed into the next compartment, which was empty. \u2013 But now I\u2019m back in the present, my pausing finger\nStill allowing the song to go on to its awful end\nOn the radio fifty years later; and I believe\nI can still hear him singing over the slow wheels\nThat carried us on to a place he said \u2018didn\u2019t deserve us\u2019, His howling impassioned tenor heard through a wall\nOn which they\u2019d put, as in most of those compartments,\nA mirror, a small clear mirror, for combing\nYour hair in or pulling your face into shapes\nBetter suited to facing interviews and girlfriends Or just teaching spelling . . . Which I see myself in today,\nAs I was at twenty-six and am no longer;\nAnd I find I\u2019m crying at these two swooping voices,\nJim Farr\u2019s and Tito Schipa\u2019s, reminding me\nThat like Tosti\u2019s fishes I go on \u2018grasping for the love\u2019.\n\u00a0 \u00a0",

  "text": "Decaying rocks, like teeth; some scribbled clouds;\nA horse\u2019s rump, thick, mottled and foreshortened;\nThree charcoal crosses, waiting. And now\nI must put in the meaning. My three young men, Marco and Giovannino\nAnd Lucio, waiting to receive their parts:\nWell, let them wait. I sketch a Roman soldier,\nLong limbs, long lance; pink toga and pink ?esh;\nA red and yellow shield, with dice; pink rocks\n\u2014 Till Marco says, Come master, who is who? I need three figures: two of them tied, contorted,\nAnd grey with pain; and one shaped like the cross,\nNailed to our handiwork. His outspread arms\nAccuse us all. See what you\u2019ve done, they say. Well, boys, who wants the part? You will be hung\nIn Sant\u2019Ambrogio, and be famous. God\nWill be worshipped in your image. The two others\n(I mix my leaden wash, ash grey, slate grey)\nWill have to squirm in pain. Marco spoke first. Make me a thief, he said,\nWinding one elbow round his neck \u2014 Look, master,\nWidening his eyes, look, look, chewing his lip,\nLook how I suffer, twisting in mock distress,\nOr in distress.\nGood thief or bad? I asked. Just thief, he said. Lucio, you take the middle one. It\u2019s safe.\nThe nails aren\u2019t real. Nothing you see is real.\nI am the one who puts the godhead in;\nI add the light like meaning.\nNo, said Lucio,\nMake me a thief as well. Bad, if you like \u2014\nI\u2019m uglier than Marco. I\u2019d have said,\n\u2018If you\u2019re so clever, get us out of this.\u2019\nMarco can be the holy thief, not me. And Giovannino said, Make me a soldier,\nTaking no notice. Make me a disciple.\nHide me among the huddled women, weeping.\nOnly, not him. Anything else but him. So Lucio, ash-grey, writhes upon his cross,\nAnd Marco says, \u2018This chap\u2019s done nothing wrong,\u2019\nAnd Giovannino stands among the skulls,\nSoulful and staring.\nThey are paid and gone,\nBy now have spent the money, while I sit\nIn front of the tall cross, adding a touch\nOf yellow to the wood, adding a cloud,\nAdding the letters INRI. I sit and stare\nOn the cross rising from the stony bustle\nAmong the huddled women, empty, empty.",

Sputtering as they turned\nOnto Lambeth Bridge, he noticed the horse was gone,\nAnd the driver\u2019s top hat. All along Nine Elms Lane\nCame the long dig in of the Kaiser\u2019s war, and his wife\nWatching the buses, wondering who would get off.\nUncle Alfred had decided to stay in the Cape.\nPercy (now Graham) watched the skirts climb up\nAnkle and shin and over the knee. Harold Lloyd\nHanging out of the windows along the Clapham Road.\nOn his way to watch Perry and Hobbs and Dixie Dean\nHe thought of the coming war, and wondered when\nAnd exactly how: Pale clouds of poison gas.\nExploding Zeppelins flaming onto the grass?\nPeeled houses showing their private parts, bath, bed\nAnd intimate wallpaper. Clapham Common, South Side.\nAnd change. All vote Labour. Demobbed, he looked for a name,\nDerek or Peter or Bill or Ronnie or Jim.\nHe looked for a room; each house was a dozen bed-sits.\nHe picked up his rations, butter and bacon and sweets.\nThe traffic cluttered and chattered down Nightingale Walk,\nAnd the bus turned round. He caught it back to Hyde Park.\nThe skirts had climbed to the thigh. In Grosvenor Square\nHe got elbowed and shoved by a girl with a bouncing pair\nIn a T-shirt. Then to Wapping and White Hart Lane\nTo rough up the fuzz, or the blacks, or the Chelsea fans.\nJim lit up and damaged his health. He sat back and thought,\nIt\u2019s not what it was; and it\u2019s bloody well not what it ought,\nWhat with Pakis and students and scabs and pigs and women,\nAnd fifty pence just to get to Clapham Common.",

We were young men. We played our parts.\nWe schooled ourselves in the quiet wood.\nBy night the moon, which draws the flood,\nTugged at the rhythms of our hearts.\nAnd they were bottomless. I loved a girl who was a boy;\nI took my stand and beat my breast.\nYet what was I but fool and beast,\nWho did not so much speak as bray,\nIn bombast bottomless? I trusted I had mastery,\nUntil one night, being left alone,\nI snorted at the wandering moon\nIn terror of the mystery,\nWhich seemed quite bottomless, And out of that she spoke, who had\nNo voice, although she stirred my sense,\nWho touched me, though she had no hands,\nAnd led me where you cannot lead,\nSince it is bottomless. I tried to speak: again I brayed.\nI pinched and scratched my face: coarse hairs\nWere crisping over cheeks and ears.\nAnd when she drew me in, she made\nThe whole world bottomless. Nothing possessed me. So she said\nDo not desire to leave this wood.\nAmong the mossy clefts I hid\nWith petals where she pressed my head,\nDesire being bottomless. A most rare vision, such a thing\nAs who should say what such things be:\nMy terror turned to ecstasy,\nThe one much like the other, being\nBoth of them bottomless. And then the change. The sun came up\nBrash as a brassy hunting-horn.\nI woke and, yes, I was a man.\nWas I myself though? Self, like sleep,\nMay well be bottomless. New moon tonight. Another dream\nTo act. They laugh at our dismay.\nOh but it\u2019s nothing. Only play.\nExcept we just don\u2019t feel the same,\nFor play is bottomless. And so the story ends. My eyes\nAre sore with weeping, but I laugh\n(I who was seen to take my life),\nFor, having been an ass, I\u2019m wise\nAnd bottomless. Bottomless.",

So Nick stepped up\nand through, and there on the other side, two horses\nwith thrilled-up ears, barged him skilfully to a stop.\nI said that gate was around here \u2013 pointing a mile or two.\nWorth the way \u2013 Nick\u2019s arms across both horses \u2013 to know these two.\nDragonflies This water\u2019s steep and deep.

Then head-butting the surface to see\nat eyelash-level the whiphands of Common Backswimmers surge\nand sprint, each footing a tiny dazzle to prism.\nThen these\nsparking ornaments hovering then islanding on our shoulders\neach arching its thorax into a question: what is the blue\nthat midnights all blue? How can crimson redden before you?\nThe old map mutters that Here Be Dragons, and it lies. Here be Darters, Skimmers, drawn flame. Here, are Dragonflies.",

  "text": " after Bonnard  Between the edge of the afternoon and dusk, between the bath\u2019s white rim and the band of apricot light, she bathed, each day, as if dreaming.  From the doorway he noted her right foot hooked for balance beneath the enamel lip, body and water all one in a miasma  of mist, a haze of lavender blue. Such intimacy. A woman, two walls, a chequered floor, the small curled dog basking in a pool  of sun reflected from the tiles above the bath. Outside the throbbing heat. So many times he has drawn her, caught the obsessive  soaping of her small breasts, compressed the crouched frame into his picture space, the nervy movements that hemmed in his life.  The house exudes her still, breathes her from each sunlit corner, secretes her lingering smell from shelves of rosewood armoires,  and the folded silk chemises he doesn\u2019t have the heart to touch. And from the landing, his memory tricks, as through the open door the smudged  floor glistens with silvered tracks, her watered foot prints to and from the tub where she floats in almond oil deep in her sarcophagus of light.

VI If I could conjure shapes for you and me\nI\u2019d choose two living things that swim or fly,\nTwo fishes tumbling in a glassy sea,\nTwo eagles turning in a golden sky.\nnd in those shapes we should continue free\nAnd still in love, until the sea ran dry,\nThe air failed, and the earth dropped in the sun,\nAnd time was ended, and we two were one. XII Love and good luck breathed on the builder\u2019s hand\nWhen he took thought and set the window so,\nAnd set it facing where the bed may stand,\nAnd every day the sun will rise and show.\nFor when the sun is rising as he planned,\nWIth it a gentle wind begins to blow\nAnd darkness and the stars fade out above;\nBut your two open eyes are stars of love. XIV Counting the heavy days and heavy hours\nI measure out the prison of this town,\nAnd wear out stones with that desire of ours,\nBut not desire, by walking up and down.\nAnd you are like a city full of towers\nSet by a plain or river like\u00a0a crown;\nAnd you are like a sunset and a star:\nBut I am here alone, not where you are. XVIII LETTER Vanne, foglio gentil Coming to write my letter, overcast\nBy all the days of absence that have gone,\nI think of others passing as they passed\u2013\nSo many days of sun that never shone,\nLetters and days! And this is not the last,\nAnd I must doubt, to see them stretching on;\nAnd wonder then, why, if it would be strange,\nSooner or later, for our love to change. And yet I know our luck has won the toss\nSo many times! and most of all that day\nWhen your first letter came and I chanced to cross\nOne I had ventured\u2013half afraid to say\nWhat I felt suddenly, in dread of loss;\nAnd then your letter came, and in a way\nSaid less, but it could only be a sign! . . .\nAnd so it all comes back, to breathe and shine And so I run it through, how love began:\nThe light encounter while we hardly thought\nAnd pleasant company without a plan;\nBut then the wild desire, and we were caught.\nHow then we were afraid, and blight and ban\nHad clawed at us like devils, but we foought\nAnd in the end won sweetness from it all;\nAnd how that would be sweeter to recall. And surely we will call it up again\nOne day, and laugh to see it shine and sing\u2013\nKnow it is not a dream, but true and plain,\nAnd we shall never find a better thing!\nThen we shall bless what we have bought with pain,\nAnd close it like the two halves of a ring.\n\u2013Therefore my letter promises to go\nAnd say, I wish that I could travel so. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

Stripped bare \u00a0 For bathing in the sea, they shout and run in the warm air; \u00a0 Their flesh worn by the trade of war, revives \u00a0 And my mind towards the meaning of it strives.  \u00a0 All\u2019s pathos now. The body that was gross, \u00a0 Rank, ravenous, disgusting in the act or in repose, \u00a0 All fever, filth and sweat, its bestial strength \u00a0 And bestial decay, by pain and labour grows at length \u00a0 Fragile and luminous. \u2018Poor bare forked animal,\u2019 \u00a0 Conscious of his desires and needs and flesh that rise and fall, \u00a0 Stands in the soft air, tasting after toil \u00a0 The sweetness of his nakedness: letting the sea-waves coil \u00a0 Their frothy tongues about his feet, forgets \u00a0 His hatred of the war, its terrible pressure that begets \u00a0 A machinery of death and slavery, \u00a0 Each being a slave and making slaves of others: finds that he \u00a0 Remembers his old freedom in a game \u00a0 Mocking himself, and comically mimics fear and shame.  \u00a0 He plays with death and animality; \u00a0 And reading in the shadows of his pallid flesh, I see \u00a0 The idea of Michelangelo\u2019s cartoon \u00a0 Of soldiers bathing, breaking off before they were half done \u00a0 At some sortie of the enemy, an episode \u00a0 Of the Pisan wars with Florence. I remember how he showed \u00a0 Their muscular limbs that clamber from the water, \u00a0 And heads that turn across the shoulder, eager for the slaughter, \u00a0 Forgetful of their bodies that are bare, \u00a0 And hot to buckle on and use the weapons lying there. \u00a0 \u00a0And I think too of the theme another found \u00a0 When, shadowing men\u2019s bodies on a sinister red ground \u00a0 Another Florentine, Pollaiuolo, \u00a0 Painted a naked battle: warriors, straddled, hacked the foe, \u00a0 Dug their bare toes into the ground and slew \u00a0 The brother-naked man who lay between their feet and drew \u00a0 His lips back from his teeth in a grimace.  \u00a0 They were Italians who knew war\u2019s sorrow and disgrace \u00a0 And showed the thing suspended, stripped: a theme \u00a0 Born out of the experience of war\u2019s horrible extreme \u00a0 Beneath a sky where even the air flows \u00a0 With\u00a0lacrimae Christi. For that rage, that bitterness, those blows, \u00a0 That hatred of the slain, what could they be \u00a0 But indirectly or directly a commentary \u00a0 On the Crucifixion? And the picture burns \u00a0 With indignation and pity and despair by turns, \u00a0 Because it is the obverse of the scene \u00a0 Where Christ hangs murdered, stripped, upon the Cross. I mean, \u00a0 That is the explanation of its rage.  \u00a0 And we too have our bitterness and pity that engage \u00a0 Blood, spirit, in this war. But night begins, \u00a0 Night of the mind: who nowadays is conscious of our sins? \u00a0 Though every human deed concerns our blood, \u00a0 And even we must know, what nobody has understood, \u00a0 That some great love is over all we do, \u00a0 And that is what has driven us to this fury, for so few \u00a0 Can suffer all the terror of that love: \u00a0 The terror of that love has set us spinning in this groove \u00a0 Greased with our blood.  \u00a0 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..These dry themselves and dress, \u00a0 Combing their hair, forget the fear and shame of nakedness. \u00a0 Because to love is frightening we prefer \u00a0 The freedom of our crimes. Yet, as I drink the dusky air, \u00a0 I feel a strange delight that fills me full, \u00a0 Strange gratitude, as if evil itself were beautiful, \u00a0 And kiss the wound in thought, while in the west \u00a0 I watch a streak of red that might have issued from Christ\u2019s breast.",

The calves were tethered outside the house\nWhile I had my breakfast: the last one at home\nFor forty years. I had what I wanted (they said\nI could), so we\u2019d loaf bread and Marie biscuits. We strung the calves behind the boat,\nMe keeping clear to protect my style:\nConfirmation suit and my patent sandals.\nBut I trailed my fingers in the cool green water, Watching the puffins driving homeward\nTo their nests on Aran. On the Galway mainland\nI tiptoed clear of the cow-dunged slipway\nAnd watched my brothers heaving the calves As they lost their footing. We went in the trap,\nMyself and my mother, and I said goodbye\nTo my father then. The last I saw of him\nWas a hat and jacket and a salley stick, Driving cattle to Ballyvaughan.\nHe died (they told me) in the county home,\nAsking to see me. But that was later:\nAs we trotted on through the morning-mist, I saw a car for the first time ever,\nHardly seeing it before it vanished.\nI couldn\u2019t believe it, and I stood up looking\nTo where I could hear its noise departing But it was only a glimpse. That night in the convent\nThe sisters spoilt me, but I couldn\u2019t forget\nThe morning\u2019s vision, and I fell asleep\nWith the engine humming through the open window.",

Bless you, four-footed animal, who eats rope, skilled upon the rocks, horned with our sin; stretch your skin, stretch  it tight on our hope; we have killed you to make a thin voice that will reach  further than hope further than heaven, that will reach deep down to our gods where the thin light cannot leak, where our stretched  hearts cannot leap. Cut the rope of its throat, skilled destroyer of goats; its sin, spilled on the washed gravel, reaches  and spreads to devour us all. So the goat must be killed and its skin stretched.  2 The Barrel of the Drum  For this we choose wood of the tweneduru tree: hard duru wood with the hollow blood that makes a womb.  Here in this silence we hear the wounds of the forest; we hear the sounds of the rivers;  vowels of reed- lips, pebbles of consonants, underground dark of the continent.  You dumb adom wood will be bent, will be solemnly bent, belly rounded with fire, wound- ed with tools  that will shape you. You will bleed, cedar dark, when we cut you; speak, when we touch you.  3 The Two Curved Sticks of the Drummer  There is a quick stick grows in the for- est, blossoms twice year- ly without leaves; bare white branches crack like light- ning in the harm- attan.  But no harm comes to those who live near- by. This tree, the elders say, will never die.  From this stripped tree snap quick sticks for the festival. Its wood, heat-hard as stone, is toneless as bone.  4 Gourds and Rattles  Cal- abash trees\u2019 leaves  do not clash; bear a green gourd, burn copper in the light, crack open seeds that rattle.  Blind underground the rat\u2019s dark saw-teeth bleed the wet root, snap its slow long drag of time,  its grit, its flavour; turn the ripe leaves sour. Clash rattle, sing gourd; never leave time\u2019s dancers weary like this tree that makes and mocks our music.  5 The Gong-Gong  God is dumb until the drum speaks.  The drum is dumb until the gong-gong leads  it. Man made, the gong-gong\u2019s iron eyes  of music walk us through the humble dead to meet  the dumb blind drum where Odomankoma speaks:  ",

This is why I have packed in my birch canoe a robe made of feathers of more than 1000 different species of bird.  So that when I have finally crossed the Ocean I will have a ceremonial costume rich enough to impress in my encounter with the Great Khan.  *  We have an excellent long boat with outriggers and therefore travel dozens of miles in a day.  Furthermore, and speaking as a navigator, I can predict every fickleness of weather and also the change in direction of currents, sometime dipping my elbow into the water and sometimes my scrotum to feel the slightest change in temperature.  These are the reasons I shall be considered a saviour by my people and die in peace.  In my own mind I am a simple man who threw his spear at the stars and landed there himself.  *  I now have in my possession a map: two handfuls of mud scraped from the bank of our sacred river, flattened into a tablet, baked, then pierced with the blunt point of my compass while I spun the other, sharper leg to produce the edge of the world as I knew it,  And beyond, the salt sea on which I am perfectly at home. In this way I look down on myself. I think: I am here.  *  Astonishing how many horizons are open to me:  at one time mountainous heaps of smashed slate,  at others a vast delta of green and crimson light.  And every day a different shore shore-line ripples past bearing its cargo of white sand and dark palms.  Very beguiling they appear, but all encumbered. All spoiled by the tantrums of their local gods.  Out here there are storms too, but in the religion I have now devised for myself I am convinced the shaping hands have pulled away from us at last, so the earth hangs with no support at the centre of \u2013 what? That is the question I have in mind to answer.  *  You might suppose better charts would help me, but in spite of their much greater accuracy in terms of coastlines and interiors,  and the intricate detail guaranteed by developments in printing,  \u00a0not to mention the understanding of perspective,  empires still lie about their extent and stability.  These are the simple deceptions.  More difficult, as I continue North to my final encounter, and wave crests flickering my face grow colder, and daylight a more persistently dull dove-grey, is how to manage my desire to live in the present for all eternity, as though I had never left my home.  It transpires the last part of my journey requires me to abandon everything I once knew, even the gorgeous costume made of feathers form more than 100 species of bird.  No matter, though. It is delicious among the constellations, as the planets begin to display their gas clouds and the beautiful nebulae their first attempts at stars.  When I look over my shoulder to see my own blue eye staring back at me, I realise before I disappear I still accept what it means to be lost.",

Whose books are those? Whose ornaments? Who chose that purple orchid flowering on that shelf? And then remembering or better still accepting: me, I live there, me with you and yes of course my key fits in the lock. At which another suddenly: the sound of you already back and practicing. I recognise it. Brahms; Two Rhapsodies; the notes that stayed invisible all day sweep in like birds through newly-blackened air and land in time to sing before they sleep.",

Guillemots whitening the cliff face. Small orchids clearly still evolving in a downpour of Arctic sunlight. \u00a0 How many years are there left to cross over and show you things themselves, not my idea of things? 25, if I live to be the age of my father. I cannot explain why I have left it as late as this. \u00a0 Your black hair blows into my eyes, and I see everything moving fast now. Weather polishes the silver fields ahead. The ravens swoop down and settle in the gorgeous pages of the gospels. \u00a0",

Then on their heels crept silences: your childhood, Mother, father, sister, all held at bay, All suspect. Illness might be in the blood, Even how we laugh in our DNA.

Little one, I can\u2019t let you go. I\u2019ll be back on Thursday. Expect me.  So many imperatives. The situation had become unwieldy. She longed for buttered toast, looked furtively at her watch. I know, I know, we have so little time. The suffocating squeeze into the spongy lapels.  I\u2019ve enver felt like this before. Have you ever felt like this before? Fatigue and embarrassment were all too familiar to her. She stirred the leaves with the toe of her boot. No, she said politely. Not exactly like this. ",

And now, look:\nour guide is daring to quote from \u2018To the Small Celandine\u2019\n(never favourite of mine)\nand Roberta\u2019s foolish gasps of pleasure hang on the mist.\nIt\u2019s unfortunate, really, that he has been quite so taken in,\nso swallowed up by what one might call\na rather ordinary attractiveness.

We ate hungrily, because eating resembles hunting and hunting resembles love, and we just loved the heat-up-wipe-clean induction hob. We were hell-bent on love. Or our shoddy but realistic guesstimate. Sex, sex, sex was reliable. Walking along corridors, filling holes with plaster, Bankers Automated Clearance Services, this was sex. Restocking our mouths was sex. Stapling documents was sex. Automated weaponry was sex. Locking and unlocking doors was sex. A particularly satisfying variant involved long-distance chat with no physical contact. Who am I trying to kid? Excuse me while I peel my banana. But we did have a trick up our sleeves. Putting it all down to remote control, piloted from thousands of miles away, we could shrug off common feelings like the common cold. We could pump iron. I\u2019ll simply die if I don\u2019t. Duct tape, crude oils, minerals + multi-vits! Anxiety came as standard, or was it anticipation or a frisson of isolation? Quite apart from being indoors, mainly, quite apart from checking the forecast, quite apart from managing the mailbox, we had the wave of the future rushing under our weakening thighs. We spent years pressed to the chest of boredom/waiting, then\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 kerpoW!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a crematorium. Motion is exhausting. It\u2019s a gutsy thing to keep feeling the world\u2019s movements. And that\u2019s not really the problem anyway. There was something in the brushwork of FuckYeahNails! that reminded us of the brutal interfaces. Leopard-print lacquer was revised repeatedly. Women in face-masks attended to our chipped outer-layers. O THANX! we verbalized, because prevention of flaking was tantamount to love-making. Do you l.o.v.e the sound of trembling in late September? And then the handle came off my bicycle, right there in my hand, all slithery! Down I went, nosing tarmac, about-to-snuff-it, alone with a road-sign. !But what\u2019ll happen to the wet kiss never slapped on his hot lips?\u00a0 !I hadn\u2019t been meaning to go on about the sliminess of our situation! !How many handbags I loved and lost! !Don\u2019t dead bodies belong to others? \u00a0Slouched like a bleeding ulcer on a thirsty highway, I saw larvae collecting around the pre-rotten innards. I saw my physical make-up, proportions balanced like an aerated chocolate bar with mint polyps. It wasn\u2019t easy to breathe, as usual. Then I survived. But I hate all that BS. Language is like teeth, which, before we let language appear, were for murdering or caressing. They too have celebrations and die. A dentist weeps for the rubble scratching our molars. That\u2019s why we get so behind, the daily mega clean-up. Water, thank god, screams like brainwaves and, when it can manage it, floods a person\u2019s surfaces with no traces. Then there\u2019s the other side of the argument. Our underpants are shrinking, partly because we\u2019re in them too deep, like the contracting continents. After the saturation and the clingy fabrics, wow the circulation bubbles like butter! And melts away.",

  "text": "Your Daddy is a soldier son,\nYour Daddy\u2019s gone to War,\nHis steady hands they hold his gun,\nHis aim is keen and sure. Your Daddy\u2019s in the desert now,\nThe darkness and the dust,\nHe\u2019s fighting for his country, yes,\nHe\u2019s doing it for us. Your Daddy\u2019s coming home soon though,\nNot long now till he\u2019s back,\nWe\u2019ll dress you in your smartest shirt\nAnd meet him down the track. He\u2019ll put you on his shoulders and\nYou\u2019ll sing and clap and laugh,\nI\u2019ll wrap my arms around his waist,\nAnd hold him close at last. Your Dad ain\u2019t left the house again,\nYour Dad ain\u2019t brushed his teeth,\nYour Dad keeps getting angry son,\nAt nights he doesn\u2019t sleep. He\u2019s having his bad dreams again,\nHe seems worn out and weak,\nI\u2019ve tried to be there for him, but\nWe barely even speak. He can\u2019t think what to say to me,\nHe don\u2019t know how to tell it,\nWon medals for his bravery,\nBut just wants to forget it. He\u2019s drinking more than ever son,\nBefore, he never cried. But now,\nI wake at night and feel\nHim shaking by my side. He spoke to me at last my son!\nHe turned to me in tears,\nI held him close and kissed his face\nAnd asked him what he feared. He said it\u2019s getting darker,\nIt hasn\u2019t disappeared,\nAnd I can see it sharper\nNow the sand and smoke have cleared. There was this kid he\u2019d got to know,\nYoung boy. Just turned eighteen,\nBright and kind, his name was Joe,\nHe kept his rifle clean. Joe\u2019s girlfriend was expecting,\nJoe loved to joke and laugh,\nJoe marched in front of your old man,\nAs they patrolled a path. Everything was quiet until\nThey heard the dreaded blast.\nThe man that marched in front of Joe\nWas completely blown apart. Some shrapnel hit Joe in the face,\nGouged both eyes at once,\nThe last thing those eyes ever saw\nWas the man in front: Limbs and flesh and bone and blood,\nTorn up and thrown around,\nAnd after that \u2013 just blackness.\nThe taste, the stink, the sound. I tell you this my son because\nI know what you\u2019ll be like,\nAs soon as you\u2019ve grown old enough\nYou\u2019ll want to go and fight In whatever battle needs you,\nYou\u2019ll pledge your blood and bone,\nNot in the name of good or evil \u2013\nBut in the name of home. Your Dad believes in fighting.\nHe fights for you and I,\nBut the men that send the armies in\nWill never hear him cry. I don\u2019t support the war my son,\nI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s right,\nBut I do support the soldiers who\nGo off to war to fight. Troops just like your daddy son,\nSoldiers through and through,\nWho wear their uniform with pride,\nAnd do what they\u2019re told to do. When you\u2019re grown, my sweet, my love,\nPlease don\u2019t go fighting wars,\nBut fight the men that start them\nOr fight a cause that\u2019s yours. It seems so full of honour, yes,\nSo valiant, so bold,\nBut the men that send the armies in\nSend them in for gold, Or they send them in for oil,\nAnd they tell us it\u2019s for Britain\nBut the men come home like Daddy,\nAnd spend their days just drinking.",

All feeling, flesh.\nBrine eyes. Man, but human first.\nStand up. Tall and strong and curved.\nYour body makes my body hurt.\nA godkid. Perfect. Gloss and dirt. None of it\u2019s real, we are made manifest\nBy the hearts that bang hard on the bars of our chests \u2013\nLet them out.\nBut we can\u2019t though. Too much to lose.\nYou\u2019ve got to keep face, keep pace. Keep cool.\nAnd what do I know? You\u2019re the man here.\nI\u2019ve got to stop telling you things.\nYou\u2019ll give when you\u2019re ready.\nI\u2019ve got to stop wanting.\nYour mind\u2019s made up.\nI\u2019ve got to stop pushing.\nYou\u2019re trying to keep steady. No man\u2019s too man to hear things.\nNo tears no tantrums. Resorting to type. So handsome.\nNo woman\u2019s too woman to take it all in.\nQuietly solve it, not try and control it,\nBut fix it so subtle that no one will notice.\nBe all that you are, all woman all soft.\nAll man. All soft. All flesh. All bone. All organ.\nI find you more than yourself. I hear you talk to yourself in the night-time.\nBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t say a word to your friends. Your voice. Your tears. Your cries. Your panic.\nYou are more man when you break and weep.\nWhen you shake and sleep,\nBody wrapped around your pillow\nSafer than a body that bites back.\nYour billowing shirt as you sprint through the dirt. Night cap.\nOne for the road. But the road never loved you.\nI love you. I love what you hate in yourself.\nIt\u2019s perfect.\nLet it come out. The best boys would feel like a lady in your arms.\nThe best girls would fuck like a man, given half the chance.\nThe good ones are good ones because they are whole ones.\nWe\u2019re at our best when we mean it.\nWe all start part of a much bigger notion.\nAnd lock ourselves down like we don\u2019t have a say.\nWe come from man and woman combined\nAnd we\u2019ll carry those parts till we see our last day.\nHear me. Let it be known. Your muscles are mine, let\u2019s stretch.\nDawn by the bins. We giggle and wretch \u2013\nThe dawn\u2019s on your skin. You\u2019re shivering, wet.\nYou\u2019ll cry from your pores if not from your eyes.\nYour blood\u2019s the same colour as mine.\nWhat a man ever was is enough. It\u2019s enough.\nStop trying. Give everything up. No shame here. No woman\u2019s too woman to stand tall and strong.\nNo man\u2019s too man to want loving. Need guidance.\nAll hearts shrink before violence.\nAll fists clench for their friends.\nWe\u2019re from here.\nWe carry it.\nEverything that ever went wrong here.\nEvery single body that gave in.\nCaved in.\nBreak through the boards in the windows.\nFind a man thinner than string.\nBlinking.\nTrying to keep everything in. Foul smell of the things that we do to escape\nThere is no glamour in this. No rock and roll.\nThis is just endings. This is just grief.\nAnd you\u2019ve got a soul worth living for.\nI\u2019m blocking blows for you. But I can\u2019t protect you.\nI\u2019m too slow for you.\nI\u2019m too alive to be near all this death.\nI love you. I will not walk off.\nBut each time my heart falls out of my chest\nAnd sits there, knees pulled up to its chest\nIt strikes me that there\u2019s hardly anything left.\nFor all of the things that we learnt in this city.\nFor all of the things that it taught.\nYou are more than the last pair of trainers you bought.\nNever just one thing.\nWe\u2019re all things.\nBut all things fall short. A man is a man when he clings to his friends.\nA woman\u2019s a woman when she holds it down.\nA man is a man who takes up her cauldron.\nA woman\u2019s a woman who takes up his crown.\nAnd wears it for all the right reasons.\nAnd stirs it for all the right reasons.\nHumans.\nBorn with the bodies that need to release.\nFind me inside you.\nLet me be all that I am.\nTiresias. Wringing my hands.\nTiresias. Singing the hymns of the land. \u00a0",

Grown up, married, with children and all,\tA roof over my head. A boiling pot on the stove\tAnd a man who told me, at least twice a day,\tHe worshipped the ground I walked on!\tYes, sometimes, very late at night, he reminded me\tHow much he loved me \u2013\tVery, very, very late at night; when the children were\tFast asleep.\tWhenall the dishes were sparkling clean\tWhen the floor was swept free of all toys,\tDusted, and wiped free of meddlesome footprints\tYes, sometimes, late at night, he reminded me\tFor the third time that day, how much\tHe loved me. The fourth decade \u2013 I watched my own children,\tMy daughters, make goo-goo eyes at boys\tWhen they thought my eyes were closed\tMy ears deaf as stone\tThey whispered tingly secrets; made subtly suggestive\tGestures. Amused, I watched it all \u2013 thought, inside,\tI sighed; amused to see the pattern repeat itself. Oh, my\tGod!\tEmbarrassed, I remembered my own na?ve assumption of\tMy mother\u2019s blindness The fifth decade \u2013 there was no denying it \u2013 my children\tWere grown. Yes, they were my children; but they,\tDefinitely, were no longer children!\tDid this mean I was old?\tHow could it be \u2013 when had that happened?\tI was just discovering my essence!\tDiscovering joyful living sans fear of pregnancy,\tSin or ridicule! It was in such ecstatic sensuousness\tI entered The sixth decade \u2013 let no one misguide you,\tThe fifties are for fleshly fulfillment, sinful\tDelight, and sprightly goings on. Now, at last,\tI knew all there was to know about life.\tI\u2019d even made it, from scratch, myself\tGave it flesh, blood, and bone\tKnit and bled it into being,\tNurtured it to healthy maturity. The seventh decade \u2013 I learned to live with loss\tA huge hole came to live in my heart\tBut I learned to understand this:\tThe loss is as big as the love. I suffer\tGreatly for I have greatly loved\tI am grateful for the love that was mine.\tI suffer, but I could not have asked for less. The eighth decade \u2013 I learned to live with\tFewer and fewer friends\tFewer and fewer visits from my children\tAs their own lives grew fuller and fuller I love the four walls I call home\tI love the skin that houses the bones I call my body\tI love the people who, a long time ago,\tWere my children\tI look at their clean noses and know\tI have lived a good life. Look. Just look!\tHow they truly no longer need me! The ninth decade \u2013 I will learn the meaning of hours\tFor time is short, each hour more precious, therefore!\tThe journey is definitely longer behind me\tThe road ahead lifts with joy as I see\tFootsteps painted a bright and\tJoyful gold!\tWithout a doubt, I know, those are the footsteps\tLove has made.\tMine has been a long life \u2013 rich in experience. But now, looking back, I see all those brilliant\tMoments in my life are moments of loving,\tOf giving to others. These are moments\tWhen I transcended the self and its\tImperious demands. When I was for\tAnother \u2013 whatever it was they needed\tTo go one step forward: wife, friend;\tMother; neighbour; daughter; sister ; or\tStranger! Yes, I can see: I have been a good citizen, a decent\tHuman being.\tNow, I am eighty years old \u2013 I hope I still have\tTime enough to catch up!\tPass me that damn bottle of wine, will you?",

Sprigs and wriggling nematodes\tlift inspired shapes to glance above the mulch derived\tfrom those who went before then die Layers of\tlife rest limp and crushed beneath the holy stone of time, hidden from the spinning crazy round of sun and moon,\tand left fermenting inside the warm barrel of the earth. 2. All that pain: the bloody, hacked-off limbs of war; those injuries\ta lover\u2019s heart sustains. Lives stocked with hardened grudge\tor slow-cooked revenge. The bludgeon of recurrent thought,\tor fuzz of the drug-smudged brain. The push towards those things we love, and would not lose: an early lily, lush\tin bloom; brass ensembles filling sun-bronzed rooms; a child\timmersed, creating nests away from harm in long bush grass.\tAll this richness soon will pass, be lost, is already past, has gone. The screw rotates again; with each turn the living thread goes\tunderground. All vital cells, all life\u2019s vast loveliness, and all vile\tanguish, is delivered back to silence, to rot, to fertilize the next\tround of intrepid roots and sprouts, fiery heart- and limb-buds. Sometimes, the aftermath of life sinks deeper into soil; lakes of slow\tdecay compose thick cuds of sleep and the dark prayer of oil.",

Not one green shoot will be wasted: migrant workers, drifters, kindred  come from towns out east to stoop to the the earth this harsh-grained Lincoln dawn, then stretch by the road, their day\u2019s shift don, stopping when this man says they stop.  This one has a Master\u2019s degree, this one a girl in Brno and a girl in Grimsby. His best friend will kill a third in some skulduggery.  Some will not know, how you say, names for what they pick in English, for pleasure, tedium or anguish, for banks of poppy, wild rose, daisy.  Next summer finds them here or gone as the market or their whims dictate. The children they have yet to meet call here/there home in this/that tongue. ",

  "text": " I am climbing Mweelrea with my teeth. The lightning of hunger flashes from my blank eyes. One piece of grass leads to another. Waves lead the island of the bright cow to pasture beyond Blacksod Bay. My twitching ear to the ground takes what should be  its pulse, keener than glaciers, deeper than fjords: the thunder is all but audible. Days under wind on a one-in-one slope I have you, mountain, by your long grass root: shake me off your back and you will tumble into the sea and be lost.  A mountain with sheep on its crown is higher than any map allows, but no foot passes my threshold of cloud. I will reach the summit and never have raised my eyes. I will reach the summit and sink gently into the roof of the sky. ",

  "text": "On 27 July 1617, Donne preached at the parish chruch at Sevenoaks, of which he was rector, and was entertained at Knole, then the country residence of Richard Sackville, third earl of Dorset. I understand you well enough, John Donne\nFirst, that you were a man of ability\nEaten by lust and by the love of God\nThen, that you crossed the Sevenoaks High Street\nAs rector of Saint Nicholas:\nI am of that parish. To be a man of ability is not much\nYou may see them on the Sevenoaks platform any day\nEager men with despatch cases\nWhom ambition drives as they drive the machine\nWhom the certainty of meticulous operation\nPleasures as a morbid sex a heart of stone. That you could have spent your time in the corruption of courts\nAs these in that of cities, gives you no place among us:\nAbility is not even the game of a fool\nBut the click of a computer operating in a waste\nYour cleverness is dismissed from this suit\nBring out your genitals and your theology. What makes you familiar is this dual obsession;\nLust is not what the rutting stag knows\nIt is to take Eve\u2019s apple and to lose\nThe stag\u2019s paradisal look:\nThe love of God comes readily\nTo those who have most need. You brought body and soul to this church\nWalking there through the park alive with deer\nBut now what animal has climbed into your pulpit?\nOne whose pretension is that the fear\nOf God has heated him into a spirit\nAn evaporated man no physical ill can hurt. Well might you hesitate at the Latin gate\nSeeing such apes denying the church of God:\nI am grateful particularly that you were not a saint\nBut extravagant whether in bed or in your shroud.\nYou would understand that in the presence of folly\nI am not sanctified but angry. Come down and speak to the men of ability\nOn the Sevenoaks platform and tell them\nThat at your Saint Nicholas the faith\nIs not exclusive in the fools it chooses\nThat the vain, the ambitious and the highly sexed\nAre the natural prey of the incarnate Christ.",

  "author": "W N Herbert",
  "text": "The stranger in our city\u2019s voice is dead so keep all Dundee silent for a day, sheathe all your spoons within their mourning cases, fling all your florins in devalued Tay: let every mirror hold his fourteen faces, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 our strangest voice is dead. Our angel of the ragcart and the river, the patron saint of tinkies, whose gold lips could loose euphoric shrieks that split our hips \u2013 but now he\u2019s fallen out with song forever.  He opened up the kitschy shop that lies down crooning in our crypt-like retro hearts: he saw the gloom in Vitriola Sundays, the glamour of the wide-boy turning martyr, of being but not reaching number one \u2013 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 let lessers eat those pies. Praise chance that once delivered that voice here, those gorgeous tonsils, that deranging larynx: here electronica met its finest syrinx, but now he\u2019s broke the glass that rang so clear.  [From the Hilltown to the Hilton by white car, he sped through squalls of gull-skriek blues and autobahned it all the way to Perth, or spued five pernods with blackcurrant juice projectile-style at his career\u2019s birth \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 back in the Ballinard. Cross-breeding krautrock with hick cabaret he reared his whippet-wild songs on a diet of lonely sardines, teaching them to shit on dollar-deafened executives\u2019 parquet.]  Praise to that voice, which spans the octaves as the roadbridge spans the river\u2019s range of tides and snell winds, bullies of Siberia. It holds the spheres together as they gride and squeal, that mile-wide voice, in theory our \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 town\u2019s diapase, ya bass. His gypsy holler was holy jabber-code, our Bowie of Baldovan Terrace: hark to Billy, Bacharach of Baxter Park. He was the Shirley Bassey of Bonnybank Road.  [He was a runaway from glassing bores, from gnashing fathers and the ties that blind: he married in the pyramids of Vegas some great American bra like Hughes designed, then took off from the girl and grew oblique as \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fear dripped from every pore. He lost his passport, filled guitars with piss, or caught the look he called Swiss Eye when forced to board a plane; he endlessly divorced his old associate: certain success.  When sales were gone, and he\u2019d gone through the friends, the cash and contracts like a fine tilth streams through a riddle (money\u2019s constant, we\u2019re what flows to deadened chore or jagged crown), news came of Lily\u2019s cancer: when your mother goes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 childhood likes to end. But Billy was another person from himself \u2013 if songs are mirrors then that voice that could sing through him seemed to eye its choices, no longer wanting to belong to him.]  Lament now for the father who must touch a cheekbone in the barn at Auchterhouse, who knows it in the darkness and knows why it is so cold. Duveted in overdose, a photo album, dumbed at thirty nine \u2013 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 lament for that numb touch. Lament the kind of silence in that shed, the absence of all further variation on that one breathing theme thieved from creation: lament MacKenzie\u2019s lovely son is dead.  Lament and flood our gritty city please: let no more pearls form in its greedy bite to be flung in the Tay\u2019s unhearing glass. Dissolved, he rises like an opposite, the Catholic in all Calvinists, the lass \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 within the laddie\u2019s ease. Lorca would know this spirit: his hair, planted now in Balgay, sends up duende\u2019s shoots. His jawline was perfect. Let my tongue find its root in this town\u2019s most joyous voice, its most lamented.",

Blackfriars marks a corner of that square\nMile that keeps the city split off from the town.\nDeeply involved in a fraudulent Vatican loan\nWhich led to the implosion of his banco,\nCalvi fled to England carrying a portmanteau\nFilled with ambrosial banknotes.\u00a0\u00a0Banking on a deal\nWith Opus Dei, whereby they would acquire a\nHolding in his bank by paying off the Mafia,\u00a0\nCalvi was obliged to bankroll Propaganda Due. \u00a0\u00a0\nBankrupt \u2013 and corrupted by its puppet-master, Gelli \u2013 \u00a0\nWhile frantically attempting to plug the gaping hole\nIn his bankbooks, he had agreed to launder\nThe drug engendered profits of the Corleone family.\u00a0 He never laundered the money though.\u00a0\u00a0Instead,\nHe \u201cborrowed\u201d it to keep his ship afloat.\u00a0\nOpus Dei reasoned that with Calvi dead,\nThe total collapse of his stocks would result\nAnd this in turn dislodge their powerful\nEnemies in the Curia, opening the way for them\nTo gain total dominance of the Vatican. \u00a0\nIt was revealed by a Mafia informer\nThat Calvi had been strangled by the Mafia\u2019s\nLondon based heroin traffic manager.\u00a0\nBridges are the sacred responsibility\nOf the Whitefriars of Paris.\u00a0\u00a0But this is the bridge\nOf the masons, of the shadowy Practitioners of corporate piracy, the mighty\nOf the mercantile world; those who dictate\nThat Canary Wharf shall be shaped\nLike an obelisk and that its shadow\nShall fall over Hawksmoor\u2019s church\nWith the pyramid beside the gate at Limehouse.\nSome say Captain Smith was a mason,\nAnd so was Powhatan, who knew him\nBy some sign \u2013 and this saved Smith,\nAnd it was nothing to do with Pocahontas!\nIn this reach, on an August night in 1989,\nTwo hundred young people were partying\nAboard that tidy pleasure boat, the\u00a0Marchioness\u2026\u00a0",

I\u2019m not prepared to settle down\nWith anyone just yet.\u201d\nShe smiled the loveliest of smiles\nAnd rolled a cigarette. \u201cThen sleep with me, at least,\u201d\u00a0I sighed,\n\u201cFor money, if you like.\u201d\nSo every Friday, after that\nShe\u2019d visit on her bike. You could say I was mad for her.\nNeglecting my old mum,\nI\u2019d lie abed with Kerry-Lee,\nWhile she got through the rum. With Christmas over, mum took ill\nAnd died within a week.\nI drove up to the hospital\nAnd kissed an icy cheek. Before the crematorium\nHad turned mum into ash,\nKerry-Lee had let me know\nShe didn\u2019t need the cash. Mad for Paul, she was, you see;\nMy colleague, where I taught.\nThen everything got swallowed up\nIn one enormous nought. And there being nothing I could do\nAbout my mother\u2019s dog,\nI left her in the old folk\u2019s home\nWhere things turn into fog. \u00a0",

  "text": "\n\n\nafter Jagjit Singh \n\nLove could not have sent you, in this shroud of song,\nTo wield against death your hollow flute, tuned to chaos. \n\nWhatever the Ancients said, matter holds the world\nto its bargain of hard frost.

The poet is not \u2018here\u2019, cramped into standard\na screaming newborn in the seat one-over. This Easyjet Airbus inspired no laments\nfrom an ageing poet to his dead gay lover, even if he observed a likeness to his friend\nin the emergency landing procedure cartoon. \u201c\u2026but he is gone now, and now I am here\u2026\nwatching an Eddie Murphy film in the sky\u2026\u201d Funny how a word like \u2018here\u2019 persists,\nmaking poems seem closer than they actually are. Think of all the places these lines have been read:\na classroom, a prison, a toilet, a park, all of them equal distance from the dead.\nEven in a cylinder, high above Denmark, en route to a festival to watch Patti Smith,\n(who is a bit like a dead gay lover of my own) Kalundborg beneath me, glittering with sadness,\na map of another man\u2019s pain. I can feel the cabin pressure dropping. Thank God\nI can never come back here again.",

A thing you can hold in your hand and believe in.\nA doorknob. A cork. Sorry not like a cork. That might lead to a conceit,\nturning the inmates into champagne. The prison is wild with lies like this.\nThey sweeten the air. You can almost taste it,\nyoung lives fermenting. The men take new nicknames,\nchange their verdicts, rework their teenage tattoos\ninto gigantic, empty ideograms.\nYou know these people a little less every day. In the library, an inmate has put up a poster:\nESCAPE WITH A BOOK.\nIn the quiet hours you consider this,\nhefting the latest Jack Reacher thriller,\nwondering whether it could lay out a guard.\nMaybe Steve. Probably not Warren. Someone could tunnel under the shower block\nwith a hardback edition of Midnight\u2019s Children.\nAfter that, it\u2019s just one night sleeping rough in the forest,\ninsulated by Secrets of the Millionaire Mind.\nYou lock the office. It is 6pm.\nDaniel is standing in the middle of the Fantasy section like\nsomething incomprehensible\nhowled into a pillow. Daniel, you say. Outside, it is both snowing and not snowing.\nBoth instances are held to be equally true.\nDaniel has trained himself not to collapse ambiguity.\nIt\u2019s 6pm, you tell him. You realise he is praying,\nfilling himself with unknowns,\nthe cool palace of his mind stretching out in all directions,\nbeyond the ring-road and county borders. As you wait to turn off the light,\nyou think about a book you used to own\nabout the Black Oak Druids,\nwho thought the evening sky\nwas the same darkness they trapped inside graves.\nThe shadows somehow escape at dusk,\nrise up to scribble out the sun. Books go missing all the time\nand then the stories are forgotten, go free. You once found a new dedication written in The Bell Jar.\nFor Lisa. Because it\u2019s the only name I can remember. Snow covers the carpark.\nOnly the governor\u2019s footsteps can be seen\nas he returns to his frozen vehicle.\nHe is thinking about the ages of his children, adding them up, dividing them,\nclicking them back together again.\nHe drives towards the city,\nthis definitive interpretation of a city, adjusting the rearview mirror\nso he won\u2019t have to watch\nthe prison dissolving silently behind him like an aspirin, for example. Or like a prison.",

The counsellor calls round occasionally,\noffering various bolt-on packages:\na rainbow in a boat, medical scares, various lengths of jinx.

You survived,\u201d he says proudly,\n\u201cbecause you started as close to the end\nas you possibly could.\u201d We smiled, and Love perpetuated,\nlike needing glasses to find your glasses. I began to root for her. I wanted her to be happy.\nI handed her things and she found reasons for them.\nGod, I stared at her.

Local heroes in the making. Fine upstanding citizens. Stood now in the emptying road, beneath the clearing clouds of early day.  Time enough for a nip, a tonic to boost prognosticated fortitudes. Their brief invasion of the bar; occupying strong positions at the window-seat.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Aelfwine examining faces, each and every passer-by: the quickness or else the ease of their step, how they fumble with their front-door keys, the force with which they shut themselves inside.  \u2018 That won\u2019t be me. I will not dig myself a hidey-hole. \u2019  \u2014 as he lifts a thimble of port to his lips; his chosen weapon, his unsheathed knife, blessed with two quick kisses, pommel and point;  \u2018 I\u2019ll prove my noble line, make papa proud, take pleasure in the moral prospect of my death. \u2019  \u2014 as he wends his path through warriors, stooped low to spy a likely mark;? till he sticks an unsuspecting seaman, burrows the slender blade into their side, slid between the ribs to prick the heart;  \u2018 Even as the dead pile up around me\u2026 \u2019  \u00a0\u2014 as the dead pile up around him;  \u2018 \u2026I\u2019ll not flee the field, will not seek solace in my comfy home, not at my daughter\u2019s wailing, nor my wife\u2019s; no matter how hard she beats the cooking pot. \u2019  \u2014 as he downs the sick-sweet syrup, rises to ready his gear, is gone.

So the shield-defence is shattered. And like a bun of consecrated bread the army tears in two.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018 And should I ever meet the man that baulks\u2026 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And should he swear he never had a choice\u2026 \u2019  And Offa issues from the ale-house, winces to the bright white morning light, blindly sets his foot upon the road.  And then there is one:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leofsunu, who pours his second cup of thick black tea;  \u2018 No. No, be well assured I\u2019d not falter, nor would I flinch. \u2019  \u2014 whispered as he warms his hands; the blood to pink his fingers, make them quick;  \u2018 To die out on the field is better than to limp back lordless with my tail between my toes. \u2019  \u2014 as he levers a leaf from between his teeth, flicks a gobbet of flesh from his wrist;  \u2018 To throw my weight on enemy iron, its penetrative hardness, its tincture, its tang, would be my comfort, my homecoming. \u2019  \u2014 as he skips and twirls into the fray a spear extending from each hand, a grey whirr of blades like a blender on full; so his foes are chopped and spun aside, flung from the merry-go-round.  \u2018 Yes. Yes, that would be homely. And no one could brand me as idle if counted as one of the dead. \u2019  \u2014 as he pushes in his chair, scatters the tip they left for him to leave; small roundish wafers of metal falling like seed upon stone.  And then there are none,  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 except Dunnere: stalwart owner of this drab establishment, who shuts up shop now they\u2019re gone;  \u2018 And what if I should see my loyal patrons polished off? \u2019  \u2014 as he stacks stools on the counter, lets the blinds down, locks the doors;  \u2018 And what if they should see me shy having served so stoutly all these years. \u2019  \u2014 as he slips into a slinky leather two-piece; laces long-heeled boots about his calves;  \u2018 To see their faces sag expressionless, will I be sorrowful, will fury buoy me up? \u2019  \u2014 as he lifts his granddaddy\u2019s sword from its red-velvet case. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Its warmth of heavy metal. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His unaccustomed grip. Away from which the war-scarred edges dip.  \u2018 What youngsters did you open in your day? \u2019  A tatty cloth with which he dusts away its pitted powdering of rust,  \u00a0\u2018 Can I be sure such weaponry still works? \u2019  and tucks it underneath his overcoat, stepping from his pantry door into the midst of gathered battle-crew.",

In the plump and pastoral valley Of a leisure time, among the trees like seabirds Asleep on a glass calm, one shadow moves \u2013 The sly reminder of the forgotten appointment. All the shining pleasures, born to be innocent, Grow dark with a truant\u2019s guilt: The day\u2019s high heart falls flat, the oaks tremble, And the shadow sliding over your face divides us.

  "text": "1. How to write a poem The first line must begin\nWith a succinct, even abrupt\nCompletion of the sentence\nBegun in the title. By the third or fourth line\nWhich must be notably longer\nA superior word looms up \u2013\n\u201cSusurrous\u201d for example. A bit further on is the correct place\nFor some sort of idea,\nPerhaps that a grandchild\nIs a fruit tree in spring Or that the writer has just\nCome back \u2013 in galoshes usually \u2013\nFrom gathering duck eggs\nAnd connects the dark eaves With memory or the multi-branched\nCandelabra of the Future.\u00a0If it\u2019s not\nAlready too late, here should occur\nAn obscure word like \u201colid\u201d (Smelling offensively) or \u201coperculum\u201d\n(Fish\u2019s gill cover, lid or valve\nClosing a shell aperture)\nWith then a nudge in the direction Of extensive travel on the Sub-Continent\nWith submersion in the Ganges\nWhere one must encounter detritus\nWhich may be equated to memory\u2026 By now the poem should be\nSwaying about like a human pyramid,\nPerhaps even toppling, and the problem\nIs that of finding an exit strategy. Something extreme is called for,\nThe return of the grandchild, say,\nWith some telling detail of a fall\nFrom an orchard ladder, Or an encounter in Bali\nWith a particularly olid jackfruit\nWhose rancid kerosene sweetness\nPursues us down the corridors of memory. \u00a0",

  "author": "John Watson",
  "text": "\u201cSuch was my disposition that after the eisteddford\nI was dismayed to hear murmurings, from my wife and daughter in concert,\nThat there was a Sizzler nearby, that it was not above one block\nFrom the hall we were now quitting, and that we should repair there without delay.\nThis intelligence caused me the utmost disquiet, and I reacted\nBy giving voice immoderately to the effect that under no circumstance\nWould I countenance such a destination.\u00a0As we set off\nPromptly in that direction I continued to propose, from the rear,\nMy considerable and cogent arguments against such a course.\nAs persuasive and telling were these counters they were to no avail.\nI dragged further behind.\u00a0Once or twice my life\u2019s dear bearers\nOf delight and pride urged me to follow with more expedition.\nI continued my remonstrations little heard or, if heard,\nLittle noted.\u00a0In fact notwithstanding the mixture of cajolery and neglect\nI received in equal measure as we advanced steadily\nTowards the disagreeably named Sizzler, I would not, nay,\nCould not stem my peevish protests:\u00a0of the provisions\nI said I surmised the negative catalogue must be copious.\nI raised the spectre of containers of reheated plastics;\nI did not want to be herded like unhappy cattle in a race\nPast cornucopias draped with plastic grape leaves;\nI wanted linen, I wanted deferential attendants schooled in discretion,\nI deplored the probability of piped music.\u00a0In short,\nI presented an unanswerable case against the rash expedition\nNow dangerously imminent, yet in return went simply unanswered.\nMy sole support in this was my granddaughter who was also\nBehaving badly.\u00a0The rest of the party were however of one mind,\nNamely that we should willy nilly be made subject to a victualler\u2019s\nWhich would (I warned) embody bad taste in every sense.\nImagine then my surprise when on being seated at a table\nAnd food being placed before me I found that, as well as consuming\nAn abundance of fresh vegetables and salads pleasingly deployed\nI was obliged to accompany this with a good serving of humble pie.\nMy recital of reasons, my litany of grievances were shown\nTo be baseless;\u00a0I had to own to the unexpected excellence\nBoth of these dishes and the manner of their presentation,\nAnd had thereby to undergo the expression of that painful sentiment,\nNamely the celebration of that which, once urged upon me\nBy my wise guides, I had spurned.\u00a0For indeed I found\nThat we were not to be forced to endure without resistance\nThe caprices of wanton obsequiousness from callous staff;\nNeither jeering nor raucous serving wenches nor callow\nAnd indifferent youths would scorn our selection.\u00a0I was in truth\nTo feel none of the legendary humiliations heaped on the patron who seeks redress\nIn exchanges such as these following: \u2018Waiter, you have\nYour thumb in my soup.\u2019\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s all right Sir, it isn\u2019t hot\u2019;\n\u2018Waiter, there is a fly in my soup.\u2019\u00a0\u2018Sir, if you please,\nKeep your voice down or everyone will want one\u2019;\n\u2018Waiter, is there rice pudding on the menu?\u2019\u00a0\u2018There was, Sir,\nBut I\u2019ve wiped it off.\u2019\u00a0Even had I, from a desire to salvage\nSome vindication of my former anxiety, hoped for some small infringement,\nThere was none. Here was to be found no trace\nOf the disagreeable or demeaning.\u00a0In fact the temptation\nWas to go back for second helpings, an impulse not wholly resisted.\u201d \u00a0",

And with the cormorants getting into a sudden\nDispute, the noise competing with waves And the helicopter?\u00a0It\u2019s already too complicated,\nIsn\u2019t it, to be convincing?\u00a0No? Then if you believe this you\u2019ll believe\nAnything, and are thereby God\u2019s Gift to Fabulists. But of course you are this \u2013 and more!\u00a0And more!\nNot the least being your willingness to read on. But for some time now it cannot \u2013 surely \u2013\nHave escaped your notice that I am flirting With the idea that poetry and jokes are alike, both skirting\nThe hem of things, the indrawn breath of wonder corresponding To the hush before the punchline, the device\nOf enjambment being somehow like the nudge nudge Of double meaning.\u00a0Anyway you will not, I hope,\nObject if a few old jokes become the subject, nay The text, in an exercise in exploring this claim;\n(For example:) \u201cWhat do you get when you cross A sheep and a kangaroo?\u201d\u00a0You\u2019ll know this one.\nThe answer is (You knew) \u201cYou get a woolly jumper.\u201d Now you must note the peculiar way the word jumper\nTakes on something of the frisson of poetry.\u00a0Hey?

Next, \u201cWhat do you get if you cross a road\nWith a chicken?\u201d\u00a0\u201cYou get the answer to a question Which has long occupied us.\u201d\u00a0This one is a bit\nDevious and I beg you to consider whether or not Your groan may resemble just a little the gasp\nAt the startlement of poetry?\u00a0Next A more extended excursion into charmed narrative\nWith its familiar Ciceronian reliance on three.\u00a0A man Is walking down the street with his girlfriend.\nThey pause outside a jeweller\u2019s shop where she sees A diamond bracelet in the window.\u00a0The man\nTakes a brick from his pocket, smashes The window and gives her the diamonds.\nAt the next jeweller\u2019s shop she admires A ruby necklace.\u00a0He takes a brick from his pocket,\nSmashes the window and gives her the rubies. At the next jeweller\u2019s window she admires pearls.\nHe says, Do you think I\u2019m made of bricks? Different?\u00a0Might the difference here suggest\nThat between simile and metaphor?\u00a0Too optimistic? Consider then, \u201cShe was only the antique-dealer\u2019s daughter\nBut she wouldn\u2019t allow much on the sofa.\u201d (Superior, you\u2019ll agree, to \u201cShe was only\nThe farrier\u2019s daughter but all of the horse manure.\u201d) Or \u201cOne thing I learnt at school was this \u2013\nThat double negatives are a definite no-no.\u201d Or \u201cI went out with a pair of twins last night.\u201d\n\u201cDid you have a good time?\u201d\u00a0\u201cYes and no.\u201d Or \u201cJudge:\u00a0\u2018Is this the first time you\u2019ve been up before me?\u2019\nDefendant:\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u00a0What time do you get up?\u2019 Or \u201cYou\u2019ve got to hand it to the Venus de Milo.\u201d\n(Note here the odd resemblance to the poetic Where the text takes away with one hand\nWhat it seems to be proposing with the other.) Too much?\u00a0Well, yes.\u00a0And yet \u2013 and yet \u2013\nHow prodigal the waves in the estuary of the present. But after this sustained barrage, no doubt\nYou have been long enough delighted.\u00a0And now The cormorants are diving again.\u00a0The sandwall\nHas fallen into the inward tide, Falling like one who no longer hopes or wishes\nTo avoid change but resigns herself To being carried along by events,\nA reader, in fact \u2013 patient and considerate \u2013 You!",

It\u2019s the way your hair grows, it\u2019s the splay of your toes, yes I love you. You\u2019re as sweet as the scents of September borne up on the breeze. As the North loves a magnet or cops love a dragnet, I love you In the darks of my heart, in the swells of the wandering wave. As the Lady loves iron or Baptists love Zion, I love you. You\u2019re as pure as poitin of Knockeen, and as sure as the grave. \u00a0 You\u2019re so fresh, you\u2019re so funny, so bang on the money, I love you, As a packet of vinegar crisps loves a lager and lime. You\u2019re so slick, you\u2019re so smart, so exclusive as art, and I love you, As an old-fashioned poet loves patterns of metre and rhyme. As an old fashioned poet I love you, you know it, I love you, Though I\u2019m crumpled and creased and obese and as ugly as sin. I\u2019m a popper of pills and I\u2019m late with my bills and I love you, And a world with you in it\u2019s a wonderful world to be in.",

War. Then sorrow. The net sags as a frontier between tufts of ragweed. Gossamer drifts where victor and loser stood preparing to serve. Well below earshot welcoming gunfire waited over the water where the bone huntsman got ready to barter a wad of black telegrams for broken athletes. \u00a0 Upstairs in the shrine put up during mourning tasselled caps hang fading by a vixen\u2019s paw dust-greyed now gummed to its wooden shield. In blurred team-photographs beardless features recede year by year from their side of the glass. No-one flicks cobwebs from the prongs of antlers. On one varnished oar nailed dry to the wall a roll-call formed a triumphant ladder of gold. The date has faded. Each bright initial is tarnished.",

Windows boarded up.\nSmashed windows betraying darkness,\nglass splinters glittering in the gutter.

It took a lot of lead \u2013\nand chemicals \u2013 and paperwork.\nIt took determination as well as an unswerving\nloyalty to the cause. It took time.\nIt took shoe-leather and medals\nand throats gone hoarse from shouting orders.\nIt took cordite \u2013 and barbed wire \u2013\nand the axe-blade.

This stone warren, lovely in torchlight, has nowhere for a horizon. Slow, cold, the stone orchards swell with petrified fruit, the narrow fields grow rough with stone barley. I knock my head against hanging columns or stumble blindly along a mineral world. The roof here is beyond the reach of your lamp. We have threaded the twists and turns for so long I cannot point back to the entrance. There\u2019s been no north, only the shuffle sideways up an uneven ledge or the crawl down slippery tunnels which join two echoing spaces. When we stand silent there is the drip of water, the faintest whisper of a distant stir of air. Don\u2019t turn off the torch again. That utter blackness squeezed against the eyeballs puts the mind out and a man\u2019s dissolved to terror, bone and skin are shadow, black blood pounds in the veins, the breath you gulp is black. Why have you brought me here? Where are you taking me? There is no end to these paths through cold limestone. In such deep caverns even the ghosts are dead.",

Still, as I\u2019ve heard my dad say, he and his children may not always be brilliant but we always turn up, and in time when the beast comes to realise that I haven\u2019t tried to escape he\u2019ll give me leave one Sunday a month to visit my family and access to his vast library  and in bed at night reading by the light of a candle I\u2019ll shut another calf-bound volume and listen to its quality thud with something like happiness.",

The baby was born in an annexe\nNext to the local pub.\nAt midnight, a delegation\nTurned up from the Farmers\u2019 Club. They talked about an explosion\nThat made a hole in the sky,\nSaid they\u2019d been sent to the Lamb and Flag\nTo see God come down from on high. A few days later a bishop\nAnd a five-star general were seen\nWith the head of an African country\nIn a bullet-proof limousine. \u2018We\u2019ve come,\u2019 they said \u2018with tokens\nFor the little boy to choose.\u2019\nTold the tale about war and peace\nIn the television news. After them came the soldiers\nWith rifle and bombs and gun,\nLooking for enemies of the state.\nThe family had packed up and gone. When they got back to the village\nThe neighbours said, to a man,\n\u2018That boy will never be one of us,\nThough he does what he blessed well can.\u2019 He went round to all the people\nA paper crown on his head.\nHere is some bread from my father.\nTake, eat, he said. Nobody seemed very hungry.\nNobody seemed to care.\nNobody saw the God in himself\nQuietly standing there. He finished up in the papers,\nHe came to a very bad end.\nHe was charged with bringing the living to life.\nNo man was that prisoner\u2019s friend. There\u2019s only one kind of punishment\nTo fit that kind of crime.\nThey rigged a trial and shot him dead.\nThey were only just in time. They lifted the young man by the leg,\nThy lifted him by the arm,\nThey locked him in a cathedral\nIn case he came to harm. They stored him safe as water\nUnder seven rocks.\nOne Sunday morning he burst out\nLike a jack-in-the-box. Through the town he went walking.\nHe showed them the holes in his head.\nNow do you want any loaves?  he cried.\n\u2018Not today\u2019 they said.",

YEATS My soul looked down from a vague height, with Death,\nAs unremembering how I rose or why,\nAnd saw a sad land, weak with sweats of dearth,\nGrey, cratered like the moon with hollow woe,\nAnd pitted with great pocks and scabs of plagues. Across its beard, that horror of harsh wire,\nThere moved thin caterpillars, slowly uncoiled.\nIt seemed they pushed themselves to be as plugs\nOf ditches, where they writhed and shrivelled, killed. By them had slimy paths been trailed and scraped\nRound myriad warts that might be little hills. From gloom\u2019s last dregs these long-strewn creatures crept,\nAnd vanished out of dawn down hidden holes. (And smell came up from those foul openings\nAs out of mouths, or deep wounds deepening.) On dithering feet upgathered, more and more,\nBrown strings, towards strings of grey, with bristling\nspines,\nAll migrants from green fields, intent on mire. Those that were grey, of more abundant spawns,\nRamped on the rest and ate them and were eaten. I saw their bitten backs curve, loop, and straighten.\nI watched those agonies curl, lift, and flatten. Whereat, in terror what that sight might mean,\nI reeled and shivered earthward like a feather. And Death fell with me, like a deepening moan.\nAnd He, picking a manner of worm, which half\nhad hid\nIts bruises in the earth, but crawled no further,\nShowed me its feet, the feet of many men,\nAnd the fresh-severed head of it, my head.",

On acres of the seeded grasses\nThe changing burnish heaves;\nOr marshalled under moons of harvest\nStand still all night the sheaves;\nOr beeches strip in storms for winter\nAnd stain the wind with leaves. Possess, as I possessed a season,\nThe countries I resign,\nWhere over elmy plains the highway\nWould mount the hills and shine,\nAnd full of shade the pillared forest\nWould murmur and be mine. For nature, heartless, witless nature,\nWill neither care nor know\nWhat stranger\u2019s feet may find the meadow\nAnd trespass there and go,\nNor ask amid the dews of morning\nIf they are mine or no.",

My friends, we will not go again or ape an ancient rage,\nOr stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age,\nBut walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth,\nAnd see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death;\nFor there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen,\nBefore we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green.",

It matters not how strait the gate\nHow charged with punishments the scroll\nI am the master of my fate:\nI am the captain of my soul.",

  "text": "The last sunbeam\nLightly falls from the finish\u2019d Sabbath,\nOn the pavement here, and there beyond it is looking,\nDown a new-made double grave. Lo, the moon ascending,\nUp from the east the silvery round moon,\nBeautiful over the house-tops, ghastly, phantom moon,\nImmense and silent moon. I see a sad procession,\nAnd I hear the sound of coming full-key\u2019d bugles,\nAll the channels of the city streets they\u2019re flooding,\nAs with voices and with tears. I hear the great drums pounding,\nAnd the small drums steady whirring,\nAnd every blow of the great convulsive drums,\nStrikes me through and through. For the son is brought with the father,\n(In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell,\nTwo veterans son and father dropt together,\nAnd the double grave awaits them.) Now nearer blow the bugles,\nAnd the drums strike more convulsive,\nAnd the daylight o\u2019er the pavement quite has faded,\nAnd the strong dead-march enwraps me. In the eastern sky up-buoying,\nThe sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin\u2019d,\n(\u2018Tis some mother\u2019s large transparent face,\nIn heaven brighter growing.) O strong dead-march you please me!\nO moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me!\nO my soldiers twain! O my veterans passing to burial!\nWhat I have I also give you. The moon gives you light,\nAnd the bugles and the drums give you music,\nAnd my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,\nMy heart gives you love.",

Red elbows, gauzy gloves, that add\nAn icy cov\u2019ring merely;\nA wadded coat, the shape to pad,\nLike Dutch-women \u2014 or nearly. Such is CAPRICE ! but, lovely kind!\nOh ! let each mental feature\nProclaim the labour of the\u00a0mind,\nAnd leave your charms to NATURE.",

Eight years and five round-rolling moons\nHe thus saw steal away,\nDozing out his idle noons,\nAnd every night at play.

For he counteracts the Devil, who is death, by brisking about the life.\nFor in his morning orisons he loves the sun and the sun loves him.\nFor he is of the tribe of Tiger.\nFor the Cherub Cat is a term of the Angel Tiger.\nFor he has the subtlety and hissing of a serpent, which in goodness he suppresses.\nFor he will not do destruction if he is well-fed, neither will he spit without provocation.\nFor he purrs in thankfulness when God tells him he\u2019s a good Cat.\nFor he is an instrument for the children to learn benevolence upon.\nFor every house is incomplete without him, and a blessing is lacking in the spirit.\nFor the Lord commanded Moses concerning the cats at the departure of the Children of Israel from Egypt.\nFor every family had one cat at least in the bag.\nFor the English Cats are the best in Europe.\nFor he is the cleanest in the use of his forepaws of any quadruped.\nFor the dexterity of his defense is an instance of the love of God to him exceedingly.\nFor he is the quickest to his mark of any creature.\nFor he is tenacious of his point.\nFor he is a mixture of gravity and waggery.\nFor he knows that God is his Saviour.\nFor there is nothing sweeter than his peace when at rest.\nFor there is nothing brisker than his life when in motion.\nFor he is of the Lord\u2019s poor, and so indeed is he called by benevolence perpetually\u2013Poor Jeoffry! poor Jeoffry! the rat has bit thy throat.\nFor I bless the name of the Lord Jesus that Jeoffry is better.\nFor the divine spirit comes about his body to sustain it in complete cat.\nFor his tongue is exceeding pure so that it has in purity what it wants in music. For he is docile and can learn certain things.\nFor he can sit up with gravity, which is patience upon approbation.\nFor he can fetch and carry, which is patience in employment.\nFor he can jump over a stick, which is patience upon proof positive.\nFor he can spraggle upon waggle at the word of command.\nFor he can jump from an eminence into his master\u2019s bosom.\nFor he can catch the cork and toss it again.\nFor he is hated by the hypocrite and miser.\nFor the former is afraid of detection.\nFor the latter refuses the charge.\nFor he camels his back to bear the first notion of business.\nFor he is good to think on, if a man would express himself neatly.\nFor he made a great figure in Egypt for his signal services.\nFor he killed the Icneumon rat, very pernicious by land.\nFor his ears are so acute that they sting again.\nFor from this proceeds the passing quickness of his attention.\nFor by stroking of him I have found out electricity.\nFor I perceived God\u2019s light about him both wax and fire.\nFor the electrical fire is the spiritual substance which God sends from heaven to sustain the bodies both of man and beast.\nFor God has blessed him in the variety of his movements.\nFor, though he cannot fly, he is an excellent clamberer.\nFor his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other quadruped. For he can tread to all the measures upon the music.\nFor he can swim for life.\nFor he can creep.",

Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,\nAnd all the air a solemn stillness holds,\nSave where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\nAnd drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds; Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow\u2019r\nThe moping owl does to the moon complain\nOf such, as wand\u2019ring near her secret bow\u2019r,\nMolest her ancient solitary reign. Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree\u2019s shade,\nWhere heaves the turf in many a mould\u2019ring heap,\nEach in his narrow cell for ever laid,\nThe rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep. The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,\nThe swallow twitt\u2019ring from the straw-built shed,\nThe cock\u2019s shrill clarion, or the ecchoing horn,\nNo more shall rouse them from their lowly bed. For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,\nOr busy housewife ply her evening care:\nNo children run to lisp their sire\u2019s return,\nOr climb his knees the envied kiss to share. Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,\nTheir furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;\nHow jocund did they drive their team afield!\nHow bow\u2019d the woods beneath their sturdy stroke! Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,\nTheir homely joys, and destiny obscure;\nNor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile,\nThe short and simple annals of the poor. The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow\u2019r,\nAnd all that beauty, all that wealth e\u2019er gave,\nAwaits alike th\u2019 inevitable hour.\nThe paths of glory lead but to the grave. Nor you, ye Proud, impute to These the fault,\nIf Mem\u2019ry o\u2019er their Tomb no Trophies raise,\nWhere thro\u2019 the long-drawn isle and fretted vault\nThe pealing anthem swells the note of praise. Can storied urn or animated bust\nBack to its mansion call the fleeting breath?\nCan Honour\u2019s voice provoke the silent dust,\nOr Flatt\u2019ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death? Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid\nSome heart once pregnant with celestial fire,\nHands, that the rod of empire might have sway\u2019d,\nOr wak\u2019d to exstasy the living lyre. But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page\nRich with the spoils of time did ne\u2019er unroll;\nChill Penury repress\u2019d their noble rage,\nAnd froze the genial current of the soul. Full many a gem of purest ray serene,\nThe dark unfathom\u2019d caves of ocean bear:\nFull many a flower is born to blush unseen,\nAnd waste its sweetness on the desert air. Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast\nThe little Tyrant of his fields withstood;\nSome mute inglorious Milton here may rest,\nSome Cromwell guiltless of his country\u2019s blood. Th\u2019 applause of list\u2019ning senates to command,\nThe threats of pain and ruin to despise,\nTo scatter plenty o\u2019er a smiling land,\nAnd read their hist\u2019ry in a nation\u2019s eyes Their lot forbad: nor circumscrib\u2019d alone\nTheir growing virtues, but their crimes confin\u2019d;\nForbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,\nAnd shut the gates of mercy on mankind, The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,\nTo quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,\nOr heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride\nWith incense kindled at the Muse\u2019s flame. Far from the madding crowd\u2019s ignoble strife,\nTheir sober wishes never learn\u2019d to stray;\nAlong the cool sequester\u2019d vale of life\nThey kept the noiseless tenor of their way. Yet ev\u2019n these bones from insult to protect,\nSome frail memorial still erected nigh,\nWith uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck\u2019d,\nImplores the passing tribute of a sigh.",

  "text": "My true-love hath my heart and I have his,\nBy just exchange one for the other given:\nI hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss;\nThere never was a bargain better driven.\nHis heart in me keeps me and him in one;\nMy heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:\nHe loves my heart, for once it was his own;\nI cherish his because in me it bides.\nHis heart his wound received from my sight;\nMy heart was wounded with his wounded heart;\nFor as from me on him his hurt did light,\nSo still, methought, in me his hurt did smart:\nBoth equal hurt, in this change sought our bliss,\nMy true love hath my heart and I have his.",

I am black because of what I carry \u2013\u00a0and I don\u2019t mean the sins of man or nature; mine is not that moral darkness that you oppose to the light and the love of God, but simply the chemistry of leaf and bark in water, and the need to keep my bowels free from clogging weeds that feed upon the sunlight. I am black for my own protection, and to make myself inscrutable to prying poets like you, who, in trying to expose my depths and secrets, would convey only a point of view \u2013 a moment and a place caught like a fish in a brief basket of lethal exposure, doomed to fade and die.  I was before the first anchor of human thought broke the surface of any stream, seeking the purchase of love; and I will be when only anchors remain, like rusted runes in layers of river stone.

The day you threw a  tantrum in the middle of the supermarket was the happiest day  of my life. Sometimes you say something which reveals you to be  rather stupid\u2014and I love you then, but not as much as I love you  when you are callously manipulative. Your promiscuity is like a  faithful dog at my side. When you talk about your petty affairs,  you try to make them sound grand and important \u2014 I cherish  your gaucheness and your flippancy.

It\u2019s more the way the right wine brings out the right light  and the scene reflected in your eye places me  front and centre, peering in, trying to describe the colour.  It\u2019s what the singer does between the words  that makes the words the words and not just words.  The way the crows that currant-stud the risen green  don\u2019t startle as I cycle through and crunch the gears.  Distracted weavers weave their hair into the tapestry,  a knight which leapt six hours ago makes sense now.  The way the symphony opens up only when you know  what\u2019s coming next, your place in it and why (or not).  The way the past\u2019s not even past and looking back  I overlooked the beauty of the worst of it.  The exam flunked, the form misfiled, the blown bulb  and the curtain drawn which caused the bar\u2019s inviting glow.  This way that led with more coincidence and happenstance  than a minor Victorian novel and yet with the absolute  conviction of its binding, and with gratitude, to you. ",

No-one, fuck! can stop us feeding. We ate the mines, the mills, and now The small towns in the hills are bleeding  And everyone to us is chow. The old, the weak are easy meat; a shark Will just as breezily take down The flesh of fools who loiter after dark Outside the Mitre or the Crown.  Our best bet is to get away To some backwater B&B, A rain-flecked window and a tray Of crab-paste sandwiches for tea; Gin and whisky, those slow killers, Rows of damp Victorian villas And the pub, the old Green Pillars \u2013 While they gather out at sea.",

On the bank, preserved like impurities In glass, a rutty tangle of wheel tracks, of paw- And hoof-prints, of sandal- and boot-prints. At intervals I found fire- Ravaged altars, some blackened, some Still smouldering; pools Of congealed blood, from either an offering or perhaps A wound, lay in the hollows Of the uneven floors. Near one I knelt and fingered The shards of a pot, or water clock, painted bright red And pink, like a fuchsia; tucked Up under the eaves of another, an abandoned Bird\u2019s nest, fabricated in a curious manner From scraps of wool, and brown animal hair, and a few fragments, torn but still Just legible, of papyrus \u2026 \u00a0 \u2026 now the Magi Who are all Appalling liars, believe the gods will never appear to, nor obey, A person with freckles. To one who has a fishbone Lodged in the throat, they say, \u2018Plunge Your feet in freezing water\u2019; but if it\u2019s a crust That\u2019s stuck there, the remedy is bread from the same loaf Rammed into both ears. Headaches Are best cured, they claim, by pouring vinegar Over door-hinges, and applying the resultant sludge To the temples. They venerate the mole, and trust The entrails of no creature as they trust Those of this tiny blind tunneller through the bowels Of the earth. Anyone who consumes a mole\u2019s heart, fresh And still beating, will see like a prophet Into the future. Avoid Using a vulture\u2019s feather as a toothpick; for sweet breath Rub the ashes of burnt mice mixed with honey Around the gums, then clean With a porcupine quill. Should you suffer From persistent pain in the abdomen, tear open A bat \u2026 \u00a0 \u2026 beyond Stretches a desert where flickering ghosts crowd Round the startled traveller, then vanish. Nature Would have us wonder At her ingenuity, and creates men who never spit, Who stand all day watching the burning sun journey across the sky, moving Only to shift their weight from foot To foot. Some are born with two pupils In one eye, and in the other, if you look Closely, you will see the image of a horse. There are regions Where no shadows Ever fall, where men sleep but do not dream, where human Skulls serve as water vessels. Those on whose mouths A swarm of bees settled when they were young, will sway Whole peoples with their clear Golden words in later life. But no Words spoken of any kind, in any tongue, can allay The griefs of ageing, or deny our racked bodies their final, sweet Release into oblivion: sure signs Of impending death include numbness, raucous laughter, mottled Eyes or nostrils, fingers toying obsessively with the tasselled Fringe of the bedspread . . .",

To think: only one-third gone  Of life! Two boys, two girls, still owed a living each; Two of us in love, all four the most free We\u2019d ever be, with nothing more in mind Than the next pub and no-one more inclined To wonder what was waiting than the other three.  Did I even think of what I hoped to find, Back then? Cocksure, twenty-one and walking Towards my smiling future with no fear Except of things I didn\u2019t want, and no idea I\u2019d talked it to death \u2013 while death was stalking  One of us, in fact: though we could not know. He\u2019s gone now. I stood still, while the others (Like some you might have\u2026) went, as women go, To be wives (and one a widow), mothers\u2026 This time the river\u2019s just as sluggish-high,  The fields and farmhouses in their stands of trees Are as perfect as that day; but now Too late, They say, for you to taste seclusion, ease, The beauty you see here. From the crossing-gate We have, to one who knows he too will die,  The look of permanence, of hallowed ground You cherish since you\u2019ve grasped it will remain Almost the same when you are not around To gaze at it. And this new kind of pain Goes with you as you sit in the London train,  As you walk from your station up the hill Past playground, car-park, pub\u2026Not many lights Left on at this hour. Some, sleepless still, Pace their rooms, their minds full of other nights; One smokes, arms folded on a windowsill;  One tinkers on the internet; one reads. In piss-smelling tunnels, wire-fenced alleyways, On paving stones that sprout stubborn weeds The streetlamps\u2019 slick repeated orange blaze Points the way home. I know where it leads.",

They step more lightly every year, A glimpse of neck-hair, a scent that lingers, girls Who, swinging bags with shops\u2019 names, disappear, Trailing glances, into crowds; each one unfurls Her special beauty like a fragile frond Before your famished eyes. I am what lies beyond, They seem to say, beyond the mortgage, car and wife \u2013 I am what you deserve, I am the buried life  You will never live. Are they pushed laughing onto beds By hands that unhook bras and yank down briefs? Do they wake with tongues thick-furred, heads Hot and unremembering? Crave water Running over them, cool as their long fingers? Each one a cherished daughter\u2026Schubert, jazz, It\u2019s all the same to them. As are your little griefs. It isn\u2019t fair. If you\u2019ve not changed, what has?  What is that slipping, shifting, like the sands Heaped up along a barren stretch of shore? In simmering parks, on summer streets Where they wait but not for you, furtive, you explore The curves of eyebrow, cheek and lip \u2013 Of other things too; you search left hands For seals of love, or ownership. Moving on, they can smell your old defeats.",

The car of someone hated, such as a tax collector: the seats, the steering wheel, the crumpled cigarette packets, everything is removed from the inside and replaced by a dog. Frost sparkles on the windscreens of several hundred parked cars in winter sunshine as I wander among them, trying the doors, leaving on the driver\u2019s seat of every one that opens a handful of chopped nuts. Parked cars are not greedy, not devious, not ironic, unless the handbrake is off. Some are occupied by unshaven single men in their forties or fifties, they sit hunched in silent pools of sorrow, anger and sullen pride in having no home to go home to. Once as a child I watched a car being lifted onto a flat-bed truck and taken away to a distant compound, my secret wishes still clamped beneath its wipers. My uncle had this talent: he would fiddle around beneath a parked car and emerge with a pail of milk. Brides on Saturdays make commanding gestures \u2013 halt! move left! \u2013 while women hang pots and pans, ladles and nylon brushes from the aerials of parked cars and the men read newspapers. To scatter an enemy across the outlying districts, scratch his name with a coin on the bonnets of adjacent parked cars. The car of an adulterer is painted yellow. The car of a sailor always lists to one side. For making love in, a car should be parked off the road in pouring rain. A decent mechanic can tell your fortune from the rust on the chassis, that crusty bronze. Traffic cones obstructing a parking space signify a recent death. As the dead exceed the living, so do parked cars those in motion. Over one car and then the next and then the next I make my way to the river, never touching the ground.",

Stendhal, letter to Matilde Dembowski, 11 June 1819  So that you wouldn\u2019t know I was following you, I wore a second-hand coat and green sunglasses. I arrived on the 3rd. It was open day at the asylum, madmen were out on the streets canvassing for the ruling party. A plush hotel rented rooms by the hour; in the lobby, secret policemen posed as gypsies selling lucky charms. Priests were suspicious, bank managers friendly: I seemed young and single and on the make. I entered a caf? where others of my kind were gathered in disguise: an eye patch or glass eye, a toup?e or false moustache. Women too, smoking cigars. (So that no one might know I loved you, I never spoke your name. So that no one might know you did not love me back, I became a wit, a raconteur, a boulevardier.) We debated pre-Columbian art, heatedly. The pots in the archaeological institute are fakes, every one of them, even the shards. The real ones are kept in the livery stables, packed in dry manure. The town was a hothouse, though the sky was grey. I was so lathered in sweat I couldn\u2019t sleep. I gave my coat to a beggar outside the Selci Gate, a veteran of the Somme. I took off my glasses.

I hike the forest incline to awe at its monolithic pleated hem, marvel at Rio,  lushly subdued, panoramically shimmering beneath me. I feel its blank stone eyes follow me in this sexing city  of beached homens with corrugated stomachs, g-string bonitas with football-hard buttocks, hoovered cellulite.  With my camel-hump rucksack and grunge-green shorts I feel like a poor relation in this glamorous metropolis,  yet the favela shacks, masses of tumbledown boxes, are homes for the disempowered, make picturesque hills  from afar for the muitos cruzeiros who stroll the laundered beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana at sundown.  Escaping Rio, the bus to Bahia spirals mountain precipices, vertiginous facades lubricated by gushing springs with spurt  out of nowhere. Come dawn we speed past dehydrated horizons spiked with cacti like three-pronged forks.  My swollen feel tingle as we decelerate into Salvador, where I hope the past will close in on me.   SALVADORE grips its Yoruba mother like a shawl, threadbare, tattered at the ends, yet refusing to yield  to wind, fly back over the Atlantico to home. Bahianas in white sizzle acaraje from stools, as if no sea  no history separates the from the traders of Lagos. Resting in a high-panelled room in Terreiro de Jesus,  I hear the wheels of barrow boys on its cobbles, imagine carriages clobbering its enslaved streets.  Yoruba words sign buildings, pepper Portuguese, its deities re-located in Candomble; when bloco bands  converge drumming on Praca da Se, I feel the blood of war pass into my soul, thrilling me. Rastas and hippies  carve orixas in doorways, busk, sell artefacts on mats. Entering the Afro-Brasileiro museum I secretly hope  for a clue, a photograph of a great-grandfather or mother, whom I will somehow instantly, miraculously recognise.  \u2018Any da Costas still around?\u2019 I ask the attendant. \u2018Of course. Hundreds. Thousands. Hundreds of thousands.\u2019  I leave the city of passion for the port of Belem, not knowing what to look for anymore.   I CROSS the state line into Amazon country at 4 A.M., turfed out of my seat to show proof of a yellow fever jab.  Belem is a pasty-faced city that sells hammocks. I buy one. Take the first boat out down the Amazon,  to reflect, to dream. I string my stripy bedfellow on deck, intimately close to others, returnees, mostly.  I shower in brown river water, stuff banana sarnies, avoid a blocked-up loo, and for the next fortnight  I watch the jungle fill me up as the boat slices through melted chocolate, its engine, my heart, synchronised.  We move on into solitude. My thoughts become free of the chaos of the city, uncensored, the river calms me.  I become my parents, my ancestors, my gods. We dock, a remote settlement. I stretch my pins, earthed, follow  my singing ears, Catholic hymns hybridised by drums. A hilltop church, Indian congregation, holding  palm fronds. It is Palm Sunday. I hum from the door, witness to one culture being orchestrated by another.  The past is gone, the future means transformation. The boat\u2019s horn impatiently calls me. I panic away.  To the riverbank, the jungle, the contemplation.  A RAINSTORM hammers Manaus, rivering streets. I emerge onto concrete, wobbly, the quayside spinning,  my heart replete with time and hope; I locate a Chinese eaterie, replenish my banana self on noodles,  await the dazzling sun to rainbow the Amazon sky magical again. When the downpour abates, I head  for the waterfall at Cachoera do Taruma, descend its slippery slopes, strip off, revitalised by icy cascades.  I am baptised, resolved to paint slavery out of me, the Daddy People onto canvas with colour-rich strokes.  Their songs will guide me in sweaty dreams at night. I savour the living in the world, planet of growth, of decay,  think of my island, the \u2018Great\u2019 Tippexed out of it, tiny amid massive floating continents, the African one  an embryo within me. I will wing back to Nigeria again and again, excitedly swoop over a zigzag  of amber lights signalling the higgledy energy of Lagos. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is time to leave.  Back to London, across international time zones. I step out of Heathrow and into my future.",

  "text": "She stood there in her best blue wrapper and head-tie, the silent Zenobia, and the sea poured out of her.  She stood there until the ship had pulled out of harbour, out of sight. Still, she stood there, listening  to the waves against the harbour walls. She looked out onto the Slave Coats, Bight of Benin, the Atlantic  which had brought Gregorio from Brazil, and Baba. Forever she stood there, watched the clouds converge,  prayed that her boy Taiwo would be safe on his journey, happy in his new home. She thought of her marriage  without love, her childhood home in Abeokuta, Kehinde about to give birth, and Baba \u2013 who was watching her now.  And she did not feel the salt sea stream down her face, did not feel the steady breeze blow in from parts  of the world she would never know; and when the stars appeared in the deepening sky, she felt a tug at her arm,  it was Kehinde, come to lead her from that place which gave life, took life, and she knew with a mother\u2019s love  that the sea would not bring her son back.",

Lunar Passage  \u00a0 Earth carried on in the gaps between the clouds, blue and green, fabulous with vapours. How had I lived there? How long would I be falling? \u00a0 The lines tensed. The geese rose above me like a surge of white weather. It was their season \u00a0 to vanish into the sky, and I went with them. \u00a0 ~ \u00a0 Then we were elsewhere. I felt the earth give up. We moved too fast for breath, but the lines had gone slack now, the wings stopped. We were still flying \u00a0 in a windless brightness that faded the stars to milk and water.

  "text": "Only the priest of the temple knows when it was born. He has the date in a book, so he can be ready, when its time has come, to build the fire on the altar: \u00a0 cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, twigs of balm, virgin sulphur. It will be heaped up, unlit, when the bird blunders in, faffing between the pillars like a panicked sparrow, \u00a0 but the size of an eagle, its colours now tarnished by five hundred years of sandstorms.\u00a0 Yet it remembers at last what to do, and climbs on to its nest of spice, \u00a0 lifting its neck and fanning with its wings till the sparks wake in the dull feathers and catch in their own tinder. Then it is sitting on flame, and the smell fills the air, \u00a0 incense, banquet and bonfire in one. Its trumpetings are triumph seasoned with agony. When they die down there is nothing left but a puffy cushion of ash. \u00a0 Next day the priest sifts through the coolness with his fingers and finds a maggot no bigger than a nail paring, which, by the next, has formed into a body and wings. \u00a0 And by the third morning it is a whole bird, preening the last ash from its scarlet wings and indigo back. It sputters once more round the tall spaces, and flies out. \u00a0 There is only one in the world. If you should see it, a dragonfly speck overhead as you cross the sand, it is a sign of good luck. Your journey will prosper.",

  "text": "John Keats in Winchester Say you had been for a walk by the river\namong fields of dry yellow and brown whose smell\nwas baking, as if the earth were their oven,\nbut the afternoon was warm and cold at once\nand you had noticed a numbness in the sky,\na shiver in the water, that made you yearn\nfor things with sun in them, apples, corn, honey. And say the air had been fidgety today\nso the gnats couldn\u2019t keep still, and overhead\nit was crowded with excitable swallows.\nThis was your season, the time of departure.\nYou could feel that edge in your lungs, like the tang\nof unlit bonfires or a foretaste of snow\nin the last of the sunshine, as you turned back. And you had nowhere to go now but a room\nthat stared at the blank side of a house, a street\nyou could listen to all night and hear only\nthe punctuation of footsteps and a cane,\nso you walked through the city, where the people\nhad the look of those you see on holiday\nas if only pretending to be themselves. And London was waiting for you, a poem\nyou were almost ready to try again with.\nThere was another room, a woman, a book,\nand a cold blur like rain you couldn\u2019t make out\nfrom this far away. You had to be inside\nwriting the words before you could find their shape.\nSay you were thinking of all this and standing all of a sudden, in front of an open shop\nwhere a basket of coals was seething orange\nand a man came and stabbed it into yellow,\na cornfield of sparks. Say you watched him hammer\nand thought he was beating light into a bar,\nmaking the street dark. That\u2019s when you\u2019d hug yourself\nand say, I should like a bit of fire tonight",

The wheels lurched over sprawled dead\nBut pained them not, though their bones crunched,\nTheir shut mouths made no moan.\nThey lie there huddled, friend and foeman,\nMan born of man, and born of woman,\nAnd shells go crying over them\nFrom night till night and now. Earth has waited for them,\nAll the time of their growth\nFretting for their decay:\nNow she has them at last!\nIn the strength of their strength\nSuspended\u2014stopped and held. What fierce imaginings their dark souls lit?\nEarth! have they gone into you!\nSomewhere they must have gone,\nAnd flung on your hard back\nIs their soul\u2019s sack\nEmptied of God-ancestralled essences.\nWho hurled them out? Who hurled? None saw their spirits\u2019 shadow shake the grass,\nOr stood aside for the half used life to pass\nOut of those doomed nostrils and the doomed mouth,\nWhen the swift iron burning bee\nDrained the wild honey of their youth. What of us who, flung on the shrieking pyre,\nWalk, our usual thoughts untouched,\nOur lucky limbs as on ichor fed,\nImmortal seeming ever?\nPerhaps when the flames beat loud on us,\nA fear may choke in our veins\nAnd the startled blood may stop. The air is loud with death,\nThe dark air spurts with fire,\nThe explosions ceaseless are.\nTimelessly now, some minutes past,\nThose dead strode time with vigorous life,\nTill the shrapnel called `An end!\u2019\nBut not to all. In bleeding pangs\nSome borne on stretchers dreamed of home,\nDear things, war-blotted from their hearts. Maniac Earth! howling and flying, your bowel\nSeared by the jagged fire, the iron love,\nThe impetuous storm of savage love.\nDark Earth! dark Heavens! swinging in chemic smoke,\nWhat dead are born when you kiss each soundless soul\nWith lightning and thunder from your mined heart,\nWhich man\u2019s self dug, and his blind fingers loosed? A man\u2019s brains splattered on\nA stretcher-bearer\u2019s face;\nHis shook shoulders slipped their load,\nBut when they bent to look again\nThe drowning soul was sunk too deep\nFor human tenderness. They left this dead with the older dead,\nStretched at the cross roads. Burnt black by strange decay\nTheir sinister faces lie,\nThe lid over each eye,\nThe grass and coloured clay\nMore motion have than they,\nJoined to the great sunk silences. Here is one not long dead;\nHis dark hearing caught our far wheels,\nAnd the choked soul stretched weak hands\nTo reach the living word the far wheels said,\nThe blood-dazed intelligence beating for light,\nCrying through the suspense of the far torturing wheels\nSwift for the end to break\nOr the wheels to break,\nCried as the tide of the world broke over his sight. Will they come? Will they ever come?\nEven as the mixed hoofs of the mules,\nThe quivering-bellied mules,\nAnd the rushing wheels all mixed\nWith his tortured upturned sight.\nSo we crashed round the bend,\nWe heard his weak scream,\nWe heard his very last sound,\nAnd our wheels grazed his dead face.",

Now slides the silent meteor on, and leaves\nA shining furrow, as thy thoughts, in me. Now folds the lily all her sweetness up,\nAnd slips into the bosom of the lake.\nSo fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip\nInto my bosom and be lost in me.",

The seasons bring the flower again,\nAnd bring the firstling to the flock;\nAnd in the dusk of thee, the clock\nBeats out the little lives of men. O, not for thee the glow, the bloom,\nWho changest not in any gale,\nNor branding summer suns avail\nTo touch thy thousand years of gloom: And gazing on thee, sullen tree,\nSick for thy stubborn hardihood,\nI seem to fail from out my blood\nAnd grow incorporate into thee. VII Dark house, by which once more I stand\nHere in the long unlovely street,\nDoors, where my heart was used to beat\nSo quickly, waiting for a hand, A hand that can be clasp\u2019d no more\u2014\nBehold me, for I cannot sleep,\nAnd like a guilty thing I creep\nAt earliest morning to the door. He is not here; but far away\nThe noise of life begins again,\nAnd ghastly thro\u2019 the drizzling rain\nOn the bald street breaks the blank day. CXXIII There rolls the deep where grew the tree.\nO earth, what changes hast thou seen!\nThere where the long street roars, hath been\nThe stillness of the central sea. The hills are shadows, and they flow\nFrom form to form, and nothing stands;\nThey melt like mist, the solid lands,\nLike clouds they shape themselves and go. But in my spirit will I dwell,\nAnd dream my dream, and hold it true;\nFor tho\u2019 my lips may breathe adieu,\nI cannot think the thing farewell.",

Life piled on life\nWere all too little, and of one to me\nLittle remains: but every hour is saved\nFrom that eternal silence, something more,\nA bringer of new things; and vile it were\nFor some three suns to store and hoard myself,\nAnd this grey spirit yearning in desire\nTo follow knowledge like a sinking star,\nBeyond the utmost bound of human thought.\nThis is my son, mine own Telemachus,\nTo whom I leave the sceptre and the isle\nWell-loved of me, discerning to fulfil\nThis labour, by slow prudence to make mild\nA rugged people, and through soft degrees\nSubdue them to the useful and the good.\nMost blameless is he, centred in the sphere\nOf common duties, decent not to fail\nIn offices of tenderness, and pay\nMeet adoration to my household gods,\nWhen I am gone. He works his work, I mine.\nThere lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail:\nThere gloom the dark broad seas. My mariners,\nSouls that have toil\u2019d, and wrought, and thought with me\nThat ever with a frolic welcome took\nThe thunder and the sunshine, and opposed\nFree hearts, free foreheads,\u00a0 you and I are old;\nOld age hath yet his honour and his toil;\nDeath closes all: but something ere the end,\nSome work of noble note, may yet be done,\nNot unbecoming men that strove with Gods.\nThe lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:\nThe long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep\nMoans round with many voices. Come, my friends,\n\u2018Tis not too late to seek a newer world.\nPush off, and sitting well in order smite\nThe sounding furrows; for my purpose holds\nTo sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\nOf all the western stars, until I die.\nIt may be that the gulfs will wash us down:\nIt may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\nAnd see the great Achilles, whom we knew.\nTho\u2019 much is taken, much abides; and though\nWe are not now that strength which in old days\nMoved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;\nOne equal temper of heroic hearts,\nMade weak by time and fate, but strong in will\nTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.",

I would Love you ten years before the flood, And you should, if you please, refuse Till the conversion of the Jews.

For, lady, you deserve this state, Nor would I love at lower rate. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But at my back I always hear Time\u2019s wing?d chariot hurrying near; And yonder all before us lie Deserts of vast eternity.

Let us roll all our strength and all Our sweetness up into one ball, And tear our pleasures with rough strife Thorough the iron gates of life: Thus, though we cannot make our sun Stand still, yet we will make him run.",

I call\nThat piece a wonder, now: Fra Pandolf\u2019s hands\nWorked busily a day, and there she stands.\nWill \u2018t please you sit and look at her? I said\n\u2018Fra Pandolf\u2019 by design, for never read\nStrangers like you that pictured countenance,\nThe depth and passion of its earnest glance,\nBut to myself they turned (since none puts by\nThe curtain I have drawn for you, but I)\nAnd seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,\nHow such a glance came there; so, not the first\nAre you to turn and ask thus. Sir, \u2018t was not\nHer husband\u2019s presence only, called that spot\nOf joy into the Duchess\u2019 cheek: perhaps\nFra Pandolf chanced to say, \u2018Her mantle laps\nOver my lady\u2019s wrist too much,\u2019 or \u2018Paint\nMust never hope to reproduce the faint\nHalf-flush that dies along her throat:\u2019 such stuff\nWas courtesy, she thought, and cause enough\nFor calling up that spot of joy. She had\nA heart \u2013 how shall I say? \u2013 too soon made glad,\nToo easily impressed; she liked whate\u2019er\nShe looked on, and her looks went everywhere.\nSir, \u2018t was all one! My favour at her breast,\nThe dropping of the daylight in the West,\nThe bough of cherries some officious fool\nBroke in the orchard for her, the white mule\nShe rode with round the terrace \u2013 all and each\nWould draw from her alike the approving speech,\nOr blush, at least. She thanked men, \u2013 good! but thanked\nSomehow \u2013 I know not how \u2013 as if she ranked\nMy gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name\nWith anybody\u2019s gift. Who\u2019d stoop to blame\nThis sort of trifling? Even had you skill\nIn speech \u2013 (which I have not) \u2013 to make your will\nQuite clear to such an one, and say, \u2018Just this\nOr that in you disgusts me; here you miss,\nOr there exceed the mark\u2019 \u2013 and if she let\nHerself be lessoned so, nor plainly set\nHer wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse, \u2013\nE\u2019en then would be some stooping; and I choose\nNever to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,\nWhene\u2019er I passed her; but who passed without\nMuch the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;\nThen all smiles stopped together. There she stands\nAs if alive. Will \u2018t please you rise? We\u2019ll meet\nThe company below then. I repeat,\nThe Count your master\u2019s known munificence\nIs ample warrant that no just pretence\nOf mine for dowry will be disallowed;\nThough his fair daughter\u2019s self, as I avowed\nAt starting, is my object. Nay, we\u2019ll go\nTogether down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,\nTaming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,\nWhich Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!",

When glided in Porphyria; straight \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She shut the cold out and the storm, And kneeled and made the cheerless grate \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blaze up, and all the cottage warm; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Which done, she rose, and from her form Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And laid her soiled gloves by, untied Her hat and let the damp hair fall, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, last, she sat down by my side \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And called me. When no voice replied, She put my arm about her waist, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And made her smooth white shoulder bare, And all her yellow hair displaced, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, stooping, made my cheek lie there, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And spread, o\u2019er all, her yellow hair, Murmuring how she loved me \u2014 she \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Too weak, for all her heart\u2019s endeavour, To set its struggling passion free \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From pride, and vainer ties dissever, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And give herself to me for ever.

That moment she was mine, mine, fair, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Perfectly pure and good: I found A thing to do, and all her hair \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In one long yellow string I wound \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three times her little throat around, And strangled her. No pain felt she; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I am quite sure she felt no pain. As a shut bud that holds a bee, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I warily oped her lids: again \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.

He makes the figs our mouths to meet And throws the melons at our feet, But apples plants of such a price, No tree could ever bear them twice. With cedars, chosen by his hand, From Lebanon, he stores the land, And makes the hollow seas that roar Proclaim the ambergris on shore.

And still, like little Oliver,\nHe softly asked for more;\nAnd with the utmost courtesy\nWas answered as before; Until one sleepy Summer\u2019s eve\nHe came all unaware\nUnto a place called Ruardean,\nAnd asked \u201cWho killed the bear?\u201d Then men arose and knocked him flat.\nAnother punched his head.\nAnd when the rest had done with him,\nOur gentle friend was dead. The moral of this simple tale\nIs plain. Dear friend, beware!\nIf you should visit Ruardean\nMention of any bear. If you should visit Yorkley Slad\nPause not to question why\nThey put a pig upon a wall\nTo see the band go by. And if your feet so far should stray\nAs Dymock, lest some hurt\nBefall you, make no mention of\nThe man without a shirt. Nine lives have cats, and you but one:\nRisk not that gift of God!\nIt\u2019s better to be ignorant\nThan dead beneath the sod.",

Light\nwoke me early, but the trams were late:\nI had to run for the Brandenburg gate\nskidding, groaning like a tram, and sodden\nto the knees. Von Neumann operates at t10\nand would do if the sky fell in. They lock\nhis theatre doors on the stroke of the clock \u2013\nbut today I was lucky: found a gap\nin the gallery next to a chap\nI knew just as the doors were closing. Last,\nas expected, on Von Showmann\u2019s list\nthe new vaginal hysterectomy\nthat brought me to Berlin.\nDelicately\nhe went to work, making from right to left\na semi-circular incision. Deft\ndissection of the fascia. The blood-\nblossoming arteries nipped in the bud.\nSpeculum, scissors, clamps \u2013 the uterus\ncleanly delivered, the pouch of Douglas\nstripped to the rectum, and the cavity\nclosed. Never have I seen such masterly\ntechnique. \u2018And so little bleeding!\u2019 I said\nhalf to myself, half to my neighbour.\n\u2018Dead\u2019,\ncame his whisper. \u2018Don\u2019t be a fool\u2019\nI said, for still below us in the pool\nof light the marvellous unhurried hands\nwere stitching, tying he double strands\nof catgut, stitching, tying. It was like\na concert, watching those hands unlock\nthe music from the score. And at the end\none half expected him to turn and bend\nstiffly towards us. Stiffly he walked out\nand his audience shuffled after. But\nfinishing my notes in the gallery\nI saw them uncover the patient: she\nwas dead.\nI met my neighbour in the street\nwaiting for the same tram, stamping his feet\non the pavement\u2019s broken snow, and said:\n\u2018I have to apologize. She was dead,\nbut how did you know? Back came his voice\nlike a bullet \u2018 \u2013 saw it last month, twice.\u2019 Returning your letter to an envelope\nyellower by years than when you sealed it up,\ndarkly the omens emerge. A ritual wound\nyellow at the lip yawned in my hand;\na turbulent crater; a trench, filled\nnot with snow only, east of Buchenwald.",

Centuries,\ncontinents it had crossed;\nfrom an undisclosed beginning\nspiralling to an unmapped end. II\nCrossing (at sixty) Magdalen Bridge\nLet it be a son, a son, said\nthe man in the driving mirror,\nLet it be a son. The tower\nheld up its hand: the college\nbells shook their blessing on his head. III\nI parked in an almond\u2019s\nshadow blossom, for the tree\nwas waving, waving me\nupstairs with a child\u2019s hands. IV\nUp\nthe spiral stair\nand at the top\nalong\na bone-white corridor\nthe blood tide swung\nme swung me to a room\nwhose walls shuddered\nwith the shuddering womb.\nUnder the sheet\nwave after wave, wave\nafter wave beat\non the bone coast, bringing\nashore \u2013 whom?\nNew-\nminted, my bright farthing!\nCoined by our love, stamped with\nour images, how you\nenrich us! Both\nyou make one. Welcome\nto your white sheet,\nmy best poem! V\nAt seven-thirty\nthe visitor\u2019s bell\nscissored the calm\nof the corridors.\nThe doctor walked with me\nto the slicing doors.\nHis hand upon my arm,\nhis voice \u2013 I have to tell\nyou \u2013 set another bell\nbeating in my head.:\nyour son is a mongol\nthe doctor said. VI\nHow easily the word went in \u2013\nclean as a bullet\nleaving no mark on the skin,\nstopping the heart within it. This was my first death.\nThe \u2018I\u2019 ascending on a slow\nlast thermal breath\nstudied the man below as a pilot treading air might\nthe buckled shell of his plane \u2013\nboot, glove, and helmet\nfeeling no pain from the snapped wires\u2019 radiant ends.\nLooking down from a thousand feet\nI held four walls in the lens\nof an eye; wall, window, the street a torrent of windscreens, my own\ncar under its almond tree,\nand the almond waving me down.\nI wrestled against gravity, but the light was melting and the gulf\ncracked open. Unfamiliar\nthe body of my late self\nI carried to the car. VII\nThe hospital \u2013 its heavy freight\nlashed down ship-shape ward over ward \u2013\nsteamed into night with some on board\nsoon to be lost if the desperate charts were known. Others would come\naltered to land or find the land\naltered. At their voyage\u2019s end\nsome would be added to, some diminished. In a numbered cot\nmy son sailed from me; never to come\nashore into my kingdom\nspeaking my language. Better not look that way. The almond tree\nwas beautiful in labour. Blood-\ndark, quickening, bud after bud\nsplit, flower after flower shook free. On the darkening wind a pale\nface floated. Out of reach. Only when\nthe buds, all the buds, were broken\nwould the tree be in full sail. In labour the tree was becoming\nitself. I, too, rooted in earth\nand ringed by darkness, from the death\nof myself saw myself blossoming, wrenched from the caul of my thirty\nyears\u2019 growing, fathered by my son,\nunkindly in a kind season\nby love shattered and set free.",

  "text": "Such is modern life \u2013 Stephen Dobyns The two young ones fed, bath\u2019d, zippered, read to and sung to. Asleep.\nTime now to stretch on the sofa. Time for a cigarette.\nWhen he realizes he\u2019s out. Clean out of smokes.\nHe grabs a fistful of coins, hesitates to listen before\nPulling the door softly to. Then sprints for the cornershop. When he trips on a shoelace, head first into the path of a U-turning cab.\nThe screech of brakes is coterminous with his scream.\nThe Somalian shopkeeper, who summons the ambulance, knows the face,\nBut the name or address? No \u2013 just someone he remembers\nPopping in, always with kids (this he doesn\u2019t say). Casualty is at full stretch and the white thirtyish male,\nUnshaven, with broken runners, is going nowhere. Is cleanly dead.\nAround midnight an orderly rummages his pockets: \u00a32.50 in change,\nA latchkey, two chestnuts, one mitten, scraps of paper,\nSome written on, but no wallet, cards, licence, or address book. Around 2 a.m. he\u2019s put on ice, with a numbered tag.\nAround 3 a.m. a child wakes, cries, then wails for attention.\nBut after ten minutes, unusually, goes back to sleep.\nUnusually his twin sleeps on undisturbed till six o\u2019clock,\nWhen they both wake together, kicking, calling out dada, dada Happily: well slept, still dry, crooning and pretend-reading in the half-light.\nThen one slides to the floor, toddles to the master bedroom\nAnd, seeing the empty (unmade) bed, toddles towards the stairs,\nNow followed by the other, less stable, who stumbles halfway down\nAnd both roll the last five steps to the bottom, screaming. To be distracted by the post plopping onto the mat: all junk,\nTherefore bulky, colourful, glossy, illicit. Time slips.\nNine o\u2019clock: hungry, soiled, sensing oddness and absence,\nEdgy together and whimpering now, when they discover the TV\nStill on, its 17-channel console alive to their touch. The Italian Parliament, sumo wrestling, the Austrian Grand Prix,\nOpera, the Parcel Force ad, see them through to half past nine\nWhen distress takes hold and the solid stereophonic screaming begins,\nRelentless and shrill enough to penetrate the attention\nOf the retired French pharmacist next door Who at, say ten o\u2019clock, pokes a broomstick through her rear window\nTo rattle theirs: magical silencing effect, lasting just so long\nAs it takes for the elderly woman to draw up her shopping list,\nTo retrieve two tenners from the ice-compartment, dead-lock her front doors,\nShake her head at the sunning milk, and make it to the bus. Let us jump then to 10 p.m., to the nightmare d?noument . . .\nNo, let us duck right now out of this story, for such it is:\nAn idle, day-bed, Hitchcockian fantasy (though prompted by a news item,\nA clockwork scenario: it was five days before that three-year-old\nWas discovered beside the corpse of his Irish dad in Northolt). Let us get this dad in and out of the shop, safely across the street,\nSafely indoors again, less a couple of quid, plus the listings mags\nAnd ten Silk Cut, back on board the sofa: reprieved, released, relaxed,\nThinking it\u2019s time for new sneakers, for a beard trim, for an overall\nRethink in the hair department. Time maybe to move on from the fags.",

III When God made this place\nHe made mountains and fissures\nHostile, vicious, and turned\nAway His face. Did He mean me to burn out my heart\nIn a forty-year search\nIn this wilderness\nOf snow and black birch,\nWith only a horse for company\nBeating on a white tympany?

A droughted spider sips from your tears. You are more beautiful than this fallen-down shed.

Like a Poet hidden\nIn the light of thought,\nSinging hymns unbidden,\nTill the world is wrought\nTo sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not: Like a high-born maiden\nIn a palace-tower,\nSoothing her love-laden\nSoul in secret hour\nWith music sweet as love, which overflows her bower: Like a glow-worm golden\nIn a dell of dew,\nScattering unbeholden\nIt\u2019s a real hue\nAmong the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view: Like a rose embower\u2019d\nIn its own green leaves,\nBy warm winds deflower\u2019d,\nTill the scent it gives\nMakes faint with too much sweet those heavy-winged thieves: Sound of vernal showers\nOn the twinkling grass,\nRain-awaken\u2019d flowers,\nAll that ever was\nJoyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass. Teach us, Sprite or Bird,\nWhat sweet thoughts are thine:\nI have never heard\nPraise of love or wine\nThat panted forth a flood of rapture so divine. Chorus Hymeneal,\nOr triumphal chant,\nMatch\u2019d with thine would be all\nBut an empty vaunt,\nA thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want. What objects are the fountains\nOf thy happy strain?\nWhat fields, or waves, or mountains?\nWhat shapes of sky or plain?\nWhat love of thine own kind? What ignorance of pain? With thy clear keen joyance\nLanguor cannot be:\nShadow of annoyance\nNever came near thee:\nThou lovest: but ne\u2019er knew love\u2019s sad satiety. Waking or asleep,\nThou of death must deem\nThings more true and deep\nThan we mortals dream,\nOr how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream? We look before and after,\nAnd pine for what is not:\nOur sincerest laughter\nWith some pain is fraught;\nOur sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought. Yet if we could scorn\nHate, and pride, and fear;\nIf we were things born\nNot to shed a tear,\nI know not how thy joy we ever should come near. Better than all measures\nOf delightful sound,\nBetter than all treasures\nThat in books are found,\nThy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground! Teach me half the gladness\nThat thy brain must know,\nSuch harmonious madness\nFrom my lips would flow\nThe world should listen then, as I am listening now.",

  "text": "O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,\tThou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead\tAre driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing, Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,\tPestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,\tWho chariotest to their dark wintry bed The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,\tEach like a corpse within its grave, until\tThine azure sister of the Spring shall blow Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill\t(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)\tWith living hues and odours plain and hill: Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;\tDestroyer and preserver; hear, oh hear! II Thou on whose stream, mid the steep sky's commotion,\tLoose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed,\tShook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean, Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread\tOn the blue surface of thine a?ry surge,\tLike the bright hair uplifted from the head Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge\tOf the horizon to the zenith's height,\tThe locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge Of the dying year, to which this closing night\tWill be the dome of a vast sepulchre,\tVaulted with all thy congregated might Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere\tBlack rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh hear! III Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams\tThe blue Mediterranean, where he lay,\tLull'd by the coil of his crystalline streams, Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay,\tAnd saw in sleep old palaces and towers\tQuivering within the wave's intenser day, All overgrown with azure moss and flowers\tSo sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou\tFor whose path the Atlantic's level powers Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below\tThe sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear\tThe sapless foliage of the ocean, know Thy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear,\tAnd tremble and despoil themselves: oh hear! IV If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;\tIf I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;\tA wave to pant beneath thy power, and share The impulse of thy strength, only less free\tThan thou, O uncontrollable! If even\tI were as in my boyhood, and could be The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,\tAs then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed\tScarce seem'd a vision; I would ne'er have striven As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.\tOh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!\tI fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed! A heavy weight of hours has chain'd and bow'd\tOne too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud. V Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:\tWhat if my leaves are falling like its own!\tThe tumult of thy mighty harmonies Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,\tSweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,\tMy spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one! Drive my dead thoughts over the universe\tLike wither'd leaves to quicken a new birth!\tAnd, by the incantation of this verse, Scatter, as from an unextinguish'd hearth\tAshes and sparks, my words among mankind!\tBe through my lips to unawaken'd earth The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,\tIf Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?",

We need good wives To come like sweet blessings in this hazardous limbo,\nThat feels daily as if there were no Christ, no Laws ?\nTo lie with us in the nights, help us recall the words\nWe once spoke lightly in our cities and towns\nIn the human climate of our birthplace.

O\u2019er pathless rocks,\nThrough beds of matted fern, and tangled thickets,\nForcing my way, I came to one dear nook\nUnvisited, where not a broken bough\nDrooped with its withered leaves, ungracious sign\nOf devastation; but the hazels rose\nTall and erect, with tempting clusters hung,\nA virgin scene!\u2014A little while I stood,\nBreathing with such suppression of the heart\nAs joy delights in; and, with wise restraint\nVoluptuous, fearless of a rival, eyed\nThe banquet;\u2014or beneath the trees I sate\nAmong the flowers, and with the flowers I played;\nA temper known to those, who, after long\nAnd weary expectation, have been blest\nWith sudden happiness beyond all hope.\nPerhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves\nThe violets of five seasons re-appear\nAnd fade, unseen by any human eye;\nWhere fairy water-breaks do murmur on\nFor ever; and I saw the sparkling foam,\nAnd\u2014with my cheek on one of those green stones\nThat, fleeced with moss, under the shady trees,\nLay round me, scattered like a flock of sheep\u2014\nI heard the murmur, and the murmuring sound,\nIn that sweet mood when pleasure loves to pay\nTribute to ease; and, of its joy secure,\nThe heart luxuriates with indifferent things,\nWasting its kindliness on stocks and stones,\nAnd on the vacant air. Then up I rose,\nAnd dragged to earth both branch and bough, with crash\nAnd merciless ravage: and the shady nook\nOf hazels, and the green and mossy bower,\nDeformed and sullied, patiently gave up\nTheir quiet being: and, unless I now\nConfound my present feelings with the past;\nEre from the mutilated bower I turned\nExulting, rich beyond the wealth of kings,\nI felt a sense of pain when I beheld\nThe silent trees, and saw the intruding sky.\u2014\nThen, dearest Maiden, move along these shades\nIn gentleness of heart; with gentle hand\nTouch\u2014for there is a spirit in the woods.",

  "text": "It seemed that out of the battle I escaped\nDown some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped\nThrough granites which Titanic wars had groined.\nYet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,\nToo fast in thought or death to be bestirred.\nThen, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared\nWith piteous recognition in fixed eyes,\nLifting distressful hands as if to bless.\nAnd by his smile, I knew that sullen hall;\nBy his dead smile I knew we stood in Hell.\nWith a thousand fears that vision\u2019s face was grained;\nYet no blood reached there from the upper ground,\nAnd no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan.\n\u201cStrange, friend,\u201d I said, \u201cHere is no cause to mourn.\u201d\n\u201cNone,\u201d said the other, \u201cSave the undone years,\nThe hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours,\nWas my life also; I went hunting wild\nAfter the wildest beauty in the world,\nWhich lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,\nBut mocks the steady running of the hour,\nAnd if it grieves, grieves richlier than here.\nFor by my glee might many men have laughed,\nAnd of my weeping something has been left,\nWhich must die now. I mean the truth untold,\nThe pity of war, the pity war distilled.\nNow men will go content with what we spoiled.\nOr, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled.\nThey will be swift with swiftness of the tigress,\nNone will break ranks, though nations trek from progress.\nCourage was mine, and I had mystery;\nWisdom was mine, and I had mastery;\nTo miss the march of this retreating world\nInto vain citadels that are not walled.\nThen, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels\nI would go up and wash them from sweet wells,\nEven with truths that lie too deep for taint.\nI would have poured my spirit without stint\nBut not through wounds; not on the cess of war.\nForeheads of men have bled where no wounds were.\nI am the enemy you killed, my friend.\nI knew you in this dark; for so you frowned\nYesterday through me as you jabbed and killed.\nI parried; but my hands were loath and cold.\nLet us sleep now \u2026",

Dull porters watched them, and a casual tramp\nStood staring hard,\nSorry to miss them from the upland camp.\nThen, unmoved, signals nodded, and a lamp\nWinked to the guard.

  "text": "The Frost performs its secret ministry,\nUnhelped by any wind. The owlet\u2019s cry\nCame loud \u2013 and hark, again! loud as before.\nThe inmates of my cottage, all at rest,\nHave left me to that solitude, which suits\nAbstruser musings: save that at my side\nMy cradled infant slumbers peacefully.\n\u2018Tis calm indeed! so calm, that it disturbs\nAnd vexes meditation with its strange\nAnd extreme silentness. Sea, hill, and wood,\nThis populous village! Sea, and hill, and wood,\nWith all the numberless goings-on of life,\nInaudible as dreams! the thin blue flame\nLies on my low-burnt fire, and quivers not;\nOnly that film, which fluttered on the grate, Still flutters there, the sole unquiet thing.\nMethinks, its motion in this hush of nature\nGives it dim sympathies with me who live,\nMaking it a companionable form,\nWhose puny flaps and freaks the idling Spirit\nBy its own moods interprets, every where\nEcho or mirror seeking of itself,\nAnd makes a toy of Thought. But O! how oft,\nHow oft, at school, with most believing mind,\nPresageful, have I gazed upon the bars,\nTo watch that fluttering stranger! and as oft\nWith unclosed lids, already had I dreamt\nOf my sweet birth-place, and the old church-tower,\nWhose bells, the poor man\u2019s only music, rang\nFrom morn to evening, all the hot Fair-day,\nSo sweetly, that they stirred and haunted me\nWith a wild pleasure, falling on mine ear\nMost like articulate sounds of things to come!\nSo gazed I, till the soothing things, I dreamt,\nLulled me to sleep, and sleep prolonged my dreams!\nAnd so I brooded all the following morn,\nAwed by the stern preceptor\u2019s face, mine eye\nFixed with mock study on my swimming book:\nSave if the door half opened, and I snatched\nA hasty glance, and still my heart leaped up,\nFor still I hoped to see the stranger\u2019s face,\nTownsman, or aunt, or sister more beloved,\nMy play-mate when we both were clothed alike! Dear Babe, that sleepest cradled by my side,\nWhose gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm,\nFill up the interspers\u2019d vacancies\nAnd momentary pauses of the thought!\nMy babe so beautiful! it thrills my heart\nWith tender gladness, thus to look at thee,\nAnd think that thou shalt learn far other lore,\nAnd in far other scenes! For I was reared\nIn the great city, pent \u2018mid cloisters dim,\nAnd saw nought lovely but the sky and stars.\nBut thou, my babe! shalt wander like a breeze\nBy lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags\nOf ancient mountain, and beneath the clouds,\nWhich image in their bulk both lakes and shores\nAnd mountain crags: so shalt thou see and hear\nThe lovely shapes and sounds intelligible\nOf that eternal language, which thy God\nUtters, who from eternity doth teach\nHimself in all, and all things in himself.\nGreat universal Teacher! he shall mould\nThy spirit, and by giving make it ask. Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee,\nWhether the summer clothe the general earth\nWith greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing\nBetwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch\nOf mossy apple-tree, while the nigh thatch\nSmokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall\nHeard only in the trances of the blast,\nOr if the secret ministry of frost\nShall hang them up in silent icicles,\nQuietly shining to the quiet Moon.",

All is still.\nA balmy night! and though the stars be dim,\nYet let us think upon the vernal showers\nThat gladden the green earth, and we shall find\nA pleasure in the dimness of the stars.\nAnd hark! the Nightingale begins its song,\n\u2018Most musical, most melancholy\u2019 bird!\nA melancholy bird? Oh! idle thought!\nIn Nature there is nothing melancholy.\nBut some night-wandering man whose heart was pierced\nWith the remembrance of a grievous wrong,\nOr slow distemper, or neglected love,\n(And so, poor wretch! filled all things with himself,\nAnd made all gentle sounds tell back the tale\nOf his own sorrow) he, and such as he,\nFirst named these notes a melancholy strain.\nAnd many a poet echoes the conceit;\nPoet who hath been building up the rhyme\nWhen he had better far have stretched his limbs\nBeside a brook in mossy forest-dell,\nBy sun or moon-light, to the influxes\nOf shapes and sounds and shifting elements\nSurrendering his whole spirit, of his song\nAnd of his fame forgetful! so his fame\nShould share in Nature\u2019s immortality,\nA venerable thing! and so his song\nShould make all Nature lovelier, and itself\nBe loved like Nature! But \u2019twill not be so;\nAnd youths and maidens most poetical,\nWho lose the deepening twilights of the spring\nIn ball-rooms and hot theatres, they still\nFull of meek sympathy must heave their sighs\nO\u2019er Philomela\u2019s pity-pleading strains. My Friend, and thou, our Sister! we have learnt\nA different lore: we may not thus profane\nNature\u2019s sweet voices, always full of love\nAnd joyance! \u2018Tis the merry Nightingale\nThat crowds and hurries, and precipitates\nWith fast thick warble his delicious notes,\nAs he were fearful that an April night\nWould be too short for him to utter forth\nHis love-chant, and disburthen his full soul\nOf all its music!\nAnd I know a grove\nOf large extent, hard by a castle huge,\nWhich the great lord inhabits not; and so\nThis grove is wild with tangling underwood,\nAnd the trim walks are broken up, and grass,\nThin grass and king-cups grow within the paths.\nBut never elsewhere in one place I knew\nSo many nightingales; and far and near,\nIn wood and thicket, over the wide grove,\nThey answer and provoke each other\u2019s song,\nWith skirmish and capricious passagings,\nAnd murmurs musical and swift jug jug,\nAnd one low piping sound more sweet than all\nStirring the air with such a harmony,\nThat should you close your eyes, you might almost\nForget it was not day! On moonlight bushes,\nWhose dewy leaflets are but half-disclosed,\nYou may perchance behold them on the twigs,\nTheir bright, bright eyes, their eyes both bright and full,\nGlistening, while many a glow-worm in the shade\nLights up her love-torch.A most gentle Maid,\nWho dwelleth in her hospitable home\nHard by the castle, and at latest eve\n(Even like a Lady vowed and dedicate\nTo something more than Nature in the grove)\nGlides through the pathways; she knows all their notes,\nThat gentle Maid! and oft, a moment\u2019s space,\nWhat time the moon was lost behind a cloud,\nHath heard a pause of silence; till the moon\nEmerging, a hath awakened earth and sky\nWith one sensation, and those wakeful birds\nHave all burst forth in choral minstrelsy,\nAs if some sudden gale had swept at once\nA hundred airy harps! And she hath watched\nMany a nightingale perch giddily\nOn blossomy twig still swinging from the breeze,\nAnd to that motion tune his wanton song\nLike tipsy Joy that reels with tossing head. Farewell! O Warbler! till tomorrow eve,\nAnd you, my friends! farewell, a short farewell!\nWe have been loitering long and pleasantly,\nAnd now for our dear homes.That strain again!\nFull fain it would delay me! My dear babe,\nWho, capable of no articulate sound,\nMars all things with his imitative lisp,\nHow he would place his hand beside his ear,\nHis little hand, the small forefinger up,\nAnd bid us listen! And I deem it wise\nTo make him Nature\u2019s play-mate.\nHe knows wellThe evening-star; and once, when he awoke\nIn most distressful mood (some inward pain\nHad made up that strange thing, an infant\u2019s dream)\nI hurried with him to our orchard-plot,\nAnd he beheld the moon, and, hushed at once,\nSuspends his sobs, and laughs most silently,\nWhile his fair eyes, that swam with undropped tears,\nDid glitter in the yellow moon-beam! Well!\nIt is a father\u2019s tale: But if that Heaven\nShould give me life, his childhood shall grow up\nFamiliar with these songs, that with the night\nHe may associate joy. Once more, farewell,\nSweet Nightingale! once more, my friends! farewell. \u00a0",

  "text": "\u00a0 PART V Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,\nBeloved from pole to pole!\nTo Mary Queen the praise be given!\nShe sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,\nThat slid into my soul. By grace of the holy Mother, the ancient Mariner is refreshed with rain. The silly buckets on the deck,\nThat had so long remained,\nI dreamt that they were filled with dew;\nAnd when I awoke, it rained. My lips were wet, my throat was cold,\nMy garments all were dank;\nSure I had drunken in my dreams,\nAnd still my body drank. I moved, and could not feel my limbs:\nI was so light \u2013 almost\nI thought that I had died in sleep,\nAnd was a bless\u2019d ghost. He heareth sounds and seeth strange sights and commotions in the sky and the element. And soon I heard a roaring wind:\nIt did not come anear;\nBut with its sound it shook the sails,\nThat were so thin and sere. The upper air burst into life!\nAnd a hundred fire-flags sheen,\nTo and fro they were hurried about!\nAnd to and fro, and in and out,\nThe wan stars danced between. And the coming wind did roar more loud,\nAnd the sails did sigh like sedge;\nAnd the rain poured down from one black cloud;\nThe Moon was at its edge. The thick black cloud was cleft, and still\nThe Moon was at its side:\nLike waters shot from some high crag,\nThe lightning fell with never a jag,\nA river steep and wide. The bodies of the ship\u2019s crew are inspired, and the ship moves on; The loud wind never reached the ship,\nYet now the ship moved on!\nBeneath the lightning and the Moon\nThe dead men gave a groan. They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,\nNor spake, nor moved their eyes;\nIt had been strange, even in a dream,\nTo have seen those dead men rise. The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;\nYet never a breeze up-blew;\nThe mariners all \u2018gan work the ropes,\nWhere they were wont to do;\nThey raised their limbs like lifeless tools \u2013\nWe were a ghastly crew. The body of my brother\u2019s son\nStood by me, knee to knee:\nThe body and I pulled at one rope,\nBut he said nought to me. But not by the souls of the men, nor by demons of earth or middle air, but by a blessed troop of angelic spirits, sent down by the invocation of the guardian saint. \u2018I fear thee, ancient Mariner!\u2019\nBe calm, thou Wedding-Guest!\n\u2018Twas not those souls that fled in pain,\nWhich to their corses came again,\nBut a troop of spirits blest: For when it dawned \u2013 they dropped their arms,\nAnd clustered round the mast;\nSweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,\nAnd from their bodies passed. Around, around, flew each sweet sound,\nThen darted to the Sun;\nSlowly the sounds came back again,\nNow mixed, now one by one.\nSometimes a-dropping from the sky\nI heard the sky-lark sing;\nSometimes all little birds that are,\nHow they seemed to fill the sea and air\nWith their sweet jargoning! And now \u2019twas like all instruments,\nNow like a lonely flute;\nAnd now it is an angel\u2019s song,\nThat makes the heavens be mute. It ceased; yet still the sails made on\nA pleasant noise till noon,\nA noise like of a hidden brook\nIn the leafy month of June,\nThat to the sleeping woods all night\nSingeth a quiet tune. [Additional stanzas, dropped after the first edition.] Till noon we quietly sailed on,\nYet never a breeze did breathe:\nSlowly and smoothly went the ship,\nMoved onward from beneath. The lonesome Spirit from the south-pole carries on the ship as far as the Line, in obedience to the angelic troop, but still requireth vengeance. Under the keel nine fathom deep,\nFrom the land of mist and snow,\nThe spirit slid: and it was he\nThat made the ship to go.\nThe sails at noon left off their tune,\nAnd the ship stood still also. The Sun, right up above the mast,\nHad fixed her to the ocean:\nBut in a minute she \u2018gan stir,\nWith a short uneasy motion \u2013\nBackwards and forwards half her length\nWith a short uneasy motion. Then like a pawing horse let go,\nShe made a sudden bound:\nIt flung the blood into my head,\nAnd I fell down in a swound. The Polar Spirit\u2019s fellow-demons, the invisible inhabitants of the element, take part in his wrong; and two of them relate, one to the other, that penance long and heavy for the ancient Mariner hath been accorded to the Polar Spirit, who returneth southward. How long in that same fit I lay,\nI have not to declare;\nBut ere my living life returned,\nI heard and in my soul discerned\nTwo voices in the air. \u2018Is it he?\u2019 quoth one, \u2018Is this the man?\nBy him who died on cross,\nWith his cruel bow he laid full low\nThe harmless Albatross. The spirit who bideth by himself\nIn the land of mist and snow,\nHe loved the bird that loved the man\nWho shot him with his bow.\u2019 The other was a softer voice,\nAs soft as honey-dew: Quoth he, \u2018The man hath penance done,\nAnd penance more will do.\u2019",

High on the shore sat the great god Pan\nWhile turbidly flowed the river;\nAnd hacked and hewed as a great god can,\nWith his hard bleak steel at the patient reed,\nTill there was not a sign of the leaf indeed\nTo prove it fresh from the river. He cut it short, did the great god Pan,\n(How tall it stood in the river!)\nThen drew the pith, like the heart of a man,\nSteadily from the outside ring,\nAnd notched the poor dry empty thing\nIn holes, as he sat by the river. \u2018This is the way,\u2019 laughed the great god Pan\n(Laughed while he sat by the river),\n\u2018The only way, since gods began\nTo make sweet music, they could succeed.\u2019\nThen, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed,\nHe blew in power by the river. Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan!\nPiercing sweet by the river!\nBlinding sweet, O great god Pan!\nThe sun on the hill forgot to die,\nAnd the lilies revived, and the dragon-fly\nCame back to dream on the river. Yet half a beast is the great god Pan,\nTo laugh as he sits by the river,\nMaking a poet out of a man:\nThe true gods sigh for the cost and pain,\nFor the reed which grows nevermore again\nAs a reed with the reeds in the river.",

  "text": "When thou didst entice to thee my heart,\nI thought the service brave:\nSo many joys I writ down for my part,\nBesides what I might have\nOut of my stock of natural delights,\nAugmented with thy gracious benefits. I looked on thy furniture so fine,\nAnd made it fine to me:\nThy glorious household-stuff did me entwine,\nAnd \u2018tice me unto thee.\nSuch stars I counted mine: both heav\u2019n and earth\nPaid me my wages in a world of mirth. What pleasures could I want, whose King I served?\nWhere joys my fellows were?\nThus argu\u2019d into hopes, my thoughts reserved\nNo place for grief or fear.\nTherefore my sudden soul caught at the place,\nAnd made her youth and fierceness seek thy face. At first thou gay\u2019st me milk and sweetnesses;\nI had my wish and way:\nMy days were straw\u2019d with flow\u2019rs and happiness;\nThere was no month but May.\nBut with my years sorrow did twist and grow,\nAnd made a party unawares for woe. My flesh began unto my soul in pain,\nSicknesses cleave my bones;\nConsuming agues dwell in ev\u2019ry vein,\nAnd tune my breath to groans.\nSorrow was all my soul; I scarce believed,\nTill grief did tell me roundly, that I lived. When I got health, thou took\u2019st away my life,\nAnd more; for my friends die:\nMy mirth and edge was lost; a blunted knife\nWas of more use than I.\nThus thin and lean without a fence or friend,\nI was blown through with ev\u2019ry storm and wind. Whereas my birth and spirit rather took\nThe way that takes the town;\nThou didst betray me to a lingering book,\nAnd wrap me in a gown.\nI was entangled in the world of strife,\nBefore I had the power to change my life. Yet, for I threatened oft the siege to raise,\nNot simpring all mine age,\nThou often didst with Academic praise\nMelt and dissolve my rage.\nI took thy sweetened pill, till I came where\nI could not go away, nor persevere. Yet lest perchance I should too happy be,\nIn my unhappiness,\nTurning my purge to food, thou throwest me\nInto more sicknesses.\nThus doth thy power cross-bias me; not making\nThine own gift good, yet me from my ways taking. Now I am here, what thou wilt do with me\nNone of my books will show:\nI read, and sigh, and wish I were a tree;\nFor sure I then should grow\nTo fruit or shade: at least some bird would trust\nHer household to me, and I should be just. Yet though thou troublest me, I must be meek;\nIn weakness must be stout.\nWell, I will change the service, and go seek\nSome other master out.\nAh my dear God! though I am clean forgot,\nLet me not love thee, if I love thee not.",

  "text": "Up this green woodland-ride let\u2019s softly rove,\nAnd list the nightingale \u2013 she dwells just here.\nHush! let the wood-gate softly clap, for fear\nThe noise might drive her from her home of love;\nFor here I\u2019ve heard her many a merry year \u2013\nAt morn, at eve, nay, all the live-long day,\nAs though she lived on song. This very spot,\nJust where that old-man\u2019s-beard all wildly trails\nRude arbours o\u2019er the road, and stops the way \u2013\nAnd where that child its blue-bell flowers hath got,\nLaughing and creeping through the mossy rails \u2013\nThere have I hunted like a very boy,\nCreeping on hands and knees through matted thorn\nTo find her nest, and see her feed her young.\nAnd vainly did I many hours employ:\nAll seemed as hidden as a thought unborn.\nAnd where those crimping fern-leaves ramp among\nThe hazel\u2019s under boughs, I\u2019ve nestled down,\nAnd watched her while she sung; and her renown\nHath made me marvel that so famed a bird\nShould have no better dress than russet brown.\nHer wings would tremble in her ecstasy,\nAnd feathers stand on end, as \u2019twere with joy,\nAnd mouth wide open to release her heart\nOf its out-sobbing songs. The happiest part\nOf summer\u2019s fame she shared, for so to me\nDid happy fancies shapen her employ;\nBut if I touched a bush, or scarcely stirred,\nAll in a moment stopt. I watched in vain:\nThe timid bird had left the hazel bush,\nAnd at a distance hid to sing again.\nLost in a wilderness of listening leaves,\nRich Ecstasy would pour its luscious strain,\nTill envy spurred the emulating thrush\nTo start less wild and scarce inferior songs;\nFor while of half the year Care him bereaves,\nTo damp the ardour of his speckled breast;\nThe nightingale to summer\u2019s life belongs,\nAnd naked trees, and winter\u2019s nipping wrongs,\nAre strangers to her music and her rest.\nHer joys are evergreen, her world is wide \u2013\nHark! there she is as usual \u2013 let\u2019s be hush \u2013\nFor in this black-thorn clump, if rightly guest,\nHer curious house is hidden. Part aside\nThese hazel branches in a gentle way,\nAnd stoop right cautious \u2019neath the rustling boughs,\nFor we will have another search to day,\nAnd hunt this fern-strewn thorn-clump round and round;\nAnd where this reeded wood-grass idly bows,\nWe\u2019ll wade right through, it is a likely nook:\nIn such like spots, and often on the ground,\nThey\u2019ll build, where rude boys never think to look \u2013\nAye, as I live! her secret nest is here,\nUpon this white-thorn stump! I\u2019ve searched about\nFor hours in vain. There! put that bramble by \u2013\nNay, trample on its branches and get near.\nHow subtle is the bird! she started out,\nAnd raised a plaintive note of danger nigh,\nEre we were past the brambles; and now, near\nHer nest, she sudden stops \u2013 as choking fear,\nThat might betray her home. So even now\nWe\u2019ll leave it as we found it: safety\u2019s guard\nOf pathless solitudes shall keep it still.\nSee there! she\u2019s sitting on the old oak bough,\nMute in her fears; our presence doth retard\nHer joys, and doubt turns every rapture chill.\nSing on, sweet bird! may no worse hap befall\nThy visions, than the fear that now deceives.\nWe will not plunder music of its dower,\nNor turn this spot of happiness to thrall;\nFor melody seems hid in every flower,\nThat blossoms near thy home. These harebells all\nSeem bowing with the beautiful in song;\nAnd gaping cuckoo-flower, with spotted leaves,\nSeems blushing of the singing it has heard.\nHow curious is the nest; no other bird\nUses such loose materials, or weaves\nIts dwelling in such spots: dead oaken leaves\nAre placed without, and velvet moss within,\nAnd little scraps of grass, and, scant and spare,\nWhat scarcely seem materials, down and hair;\nFor from men\u2019s haunts she nothing seems to win.\nYet Nature is the builder, and contrives\nHomes for her children\u2019s comfort, even here;\nWhere Solitude\u2019s disciples spend their lives\nUnseen, save when a wanderer passes near\nThat loves such pleasant places. Deep adown,\nThe nest is made a hermit\u2019s mossy cell.\nSnug lie her curious eggs in number five,\nOf deadened green, or rather olive brown;\nAnd the old prickly thorn-bush guards them well.\nSo here we\u2019ll leave them, still unknown to wrong,\nAs the old woodland\u2019s legacy of song.",

Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget\nWhat thou among the leaves hast never known,\nThe weariness, the fever and the fret\nHere, where men sit and hear each other groan;\nWhere palsy shakes a few, sad, last grey hairs,\nWhere youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;\nWhere but to think is to be full of sorrow\nAnd leaden-eyed despairs,\nWhere Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,\nOr new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow. Away! away! for I will fly to thee,\nNot charioted by Bacchus and his pards,\nBut on the viewless wings of Poesy,\nThough the dull brain perplexes and retards:\nAlready with thee! tender is the night,\nAnd haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,\nCluster\u2019d around by all her starry Fays;\nBut here there is no light,\nSave what from heaven is with the breezes blown\nThrough verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.

Darkling I listen; and, for many a time\nI have been half in love with easeful Death,\nCall\u2019d him soft names in many a mused rhyme,\nTo take into the air my quiet breath;\nNow more than ever seems it rich to die,\nTo cease upon the midnight with no pain,\nWhile thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad\nIn such an ecstasy!\nStill wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain \u2014\nTo thy high requiem become a sod. Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!\nNo hungry generations tread thee down;\nThe voice I hear this passing night was heard\nIn ancient days by emperor and clown:\nPerhaps the self-same song that found a path\nThrough the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,\nShe stood in tears amidst the alien corn;\nThe same that oft-times hath\nCharm\u2019d magic casements, opening on the foam\nOf perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. Forlorn! the very word is like a bell\nTo toll me back from thee to my sole self!\nAdieu! The fancy cannot cheat so well\nAs she is fam\u2019d to do, decieving elf.\nAdieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades\nPast the near meadows, over the still stream,\nUp the hill-side; and now \u2019tis buried deep\nIn the next valley-glades:\nWas it a vision, or a waking dream?\nFled is that music:\u2014 Do I wake or sleep?",

I also like to dine on Becaficas,\nTo see the Sun set, sure he\u2019ll rise tomorrow,\nNot through a misty morning twinkling weak as\nA drunken man\u2019s dead eye in maudlin sorrow,\nBut with all Heaven t\u2019 himself; the Day will break as\nBeauteous as cloudless, nor be forced to borrow\nThat sort of farthing candlelight which glimmers\nWhere reeking London\u2019s smoky Caldron simmers. XLIV. I love the language, that soft bastard Latin,\nWhich melts like kisses from a female mouth,\nAnd sounds as if it should be writ on satin,\nWith syllables which breathe of the sweet South,\nAnd gentle liquids gliding all so pat in\nThat not a single accent seems uncouth \u2013\nLike our harsh Northern whistling, grunting guttural,\nWhich we\u2019re obliged to hiss, and spit, and sputter all. XLV. I like the women too (Forgive my folly!)\nFrom the rich peasant cheek of ruddy bronze,\nAnd large black eyes that flash on you a volley\nOf rays that say a thousand things at once,\nTo the high Dama\u2019s brow, more melancholy,\nBut clear, and with a wild and liquid Glance,\nHeart on her lips, and Soul within her eyes,\nSoft as her clime, and Sunny as her skies. XLVI. Eve of the land which still is Paradise!\nItalian Beauty! didst thou not inspire\nRaphael, who died in thy embrace, and vies\nWith all we know of Heaven, or can desire\nIn what he hath bequeath\u2019d us?\u2013in what guise,\nThough flashing from the fervour of the Lyre,\nWould Words describe thy past and present Glow,\nWhile yet Canova can create below? XLVII. \u2018England! with all thy faults I love thee still!\u2019\nI said at Calais, and have not forgot it;\nI like to speak and lucubrate my fill;\nI like the Government (but that is not it);\nI like the freedom of the press and quill;\nI like the Hapeas Corpus (when we\u2019ve got it);\nI like a parliamentary debate,\nParticularly when \u2019tis not too late; XLVIII. I like the taxes, when they\u2019re not too many;\nI like a sea-coal fire, when not too dear;\nI like a beef-steak, too, as well as any;\nHave no objection to a pot of beer;\nI like the weather \u2013 when it is not rainy \u2013\nThat is, I like two months of every Year;\nAnd so God save the Regent, Church, and King!\nWhich means that I like all and every thing.",

LXVII But man is a carnivorous production,\nAnd must have meals, at least one meal a day;\nHe cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,\nBut, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;\nAlthough his anatomical construction\nBears vegetables, in a grumbling way,\nYour labouring people think, beyond all question,\nBeef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion. LXVIII And thus it was with this our hapless crew;\nFor on the third day there came on a calm,\nAnd though at first their strength it might renew,\nAnd lying on their weariness like balm,\nLulled them like turtles sleeping on the blue\nOf Ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,\nAnd fell all ravenously on their provision,\nInstead of hoarding it with due precision. LXIX The consequence was easily foreseen,\nThey ate up all they had, and drank their wine. In spite of all remonstrances, and then\nOn what, in fact, next day were they to dine?\nThey hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!\nAnd carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,\nBut as they had but one oar, and that brittle,\nIt would have been more wise to save their victual. LXX The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,\nAnd Ocean slumbered like an unweaned child:\nThe fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,\nThe sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild?\nWith their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)\nWhat could they do? and Hunger\u2019s rage grew wild:\nSo Juan\u2019s spaniel, spite of his entreating,\nWas killed, and portioned out for present eating. LXXI On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,\nAnd Juan, who had still refused, because\nThe creature was his father\u2019s dog that died,\nNow feeling all the vulture in his jaws,\nWith some remorse received (though first denied)\nAs a great favour one of the fore-paws,\nWhich he divided with Pedrillo, who\nDevoured it, longing for the other too. LXXII The seventh day, and no wind, the burning sun\nBlistered and scorched, and, stagnant on the sea,\nThey lay like carcasses; and hope was none,\nSave in the breeze that came not: savagely\nThey glared upon each other, all was done,\nWater, and wine, and food, and you might see\nThe longings of the cannibal arise\n(Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes. LXXIII At length one whispered his companion, who\nWhispered another, and thus it went round,\nAnd then into a hoarser murmur grew,\nAn ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;\nAnd when his comrade\u2019s thought each sufferer knew,\n\u2018Twas but his own, suppressed till now, he found:\nAnd out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,\nAnd who should die to be his fellow\u2019s food. LXXIV But ere they came to this, they that day shared\nSome leathern caps, and what remained of shoes;\nAnd then they looked around them, and despaired,\nAnd none to be the sacrifice would choose;\nAt length the lots were torn up, and prepared,\nBut of materials that must shock the Muse\nHaving no paper, for the want of better,\nThey took by force from Juan Julia\u2019s letter. LXXV The lots were made, and marked, and mixed, and handed,\nIn silent horror, and their distribution\nLulled even the savage hunger which demanded,\nLike the Promethean vulture, this pollution;\nNone in particular had sought or planned it,\n\u2018Twas Nature gnawed them to this resolution,\nBy which none were permitted to be neuter\nAnd the lot fell on Juan\u2019s luckless tutor. LXXVI He but requested to be bled to death:\nThe surgeon had his instruments, and bled\nPedrillo, and so gently ebbed his breath,\nYou hardly could perceive when he was dead.\nHe died as born, a Catholic in faith,\nLike most in the belief in which they\u2019re bred,\nAnd first a little crucifix he kissed,\nAnd then held out his jugular and wrist. LXXVII The surgeon, as there was no other fee,\nHad his first choice of morsels for his pains;\nBut being thirstiest at the moment, he\nPreferred a draught from the fast-flowing veins:\nPart was divided, part thrown in the sea,\nAnd such things as the entrails and the brains\nRegaled two sharks, who followed o\u2019er the billow,\nThe sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo. LXXVIII The sailors ate him, all save three or four,\nWho were not quite so fond of animal food;\nTo these was added Juan, who, before\nRefusing his own spaniel, hardly could\nFeel now his appetite increased much more;\n\u2018Twas not to be expected that he should,\nEven in extremity of their disaster,\nDine with them on his pastor and his master. LXXIX \u2018Twas better that he did not; for, in fact,\nThe consequence was awful in the extreme;\nFor they, who were most ravenous in the act,\nWent raging mad, Lord! how they did blaspheme!\nAnd foam, and roll, with strange convulsions racked,\nDrinking salt-water like a mountain-stream,\nTearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,\nAnd, with hyena-laughter, died despairing.",

The valley is silent. In shadow beneath\nThe silver birch, one daffodil. A passing thought. The frost\nIs set, the silence complete. He may already have died.\nWe hold onto the thought of him. A thought in passing. Death\nIs unreal, until silence has healed. Yet still the spindrift\nOn the glass, still the poems, still our laughter sounding out of the mist.",

We\u2019d sit easy with death at table,\nMy skeleton key in the glass,\nAnd whichever name he whispered\nWe\u2019d both wait for the shiver to pass.

I looked but I couldn\u2019t find you\nThen full-moon, the first summer breeze,\nCame running through our garden\nA white blossom for the black honey-bees.

Since when\nThe snow has come and lain forgetful on the fields, and gone\nAnd still the blackbird has never held its tongue.\nSoft light this evening in the garden, and the murmuring\nOf warm rain. One daffodil now. And the blackbird again\nHigh in the blue firtree. He sings. And then for some\nTime he listens as if for reply from beyond the rain,\nFrom a silence that is in from the sea, or beyond, listening\nFor where that diffuse quiet should end in confluent song.\nI watch from the porch him tilt his head. Then he\u2019s off again,\nTrilling, carolling. And somewhere in the house the whisper\n\u2018Amen\u2019. \u00a0",

After Recovery, that post-operative word for half an hour\nof being watched and questioned back into the world, a man I barely recognize sits up, stares through me,\nand tries to claw the bindings from his head.

As I rise to go, moonlight flares\ninto the ward, turning hospital gowns into folds of alabaster, wired to fluids and electricity.\nSomewhere near, a woman laughs from the depths of sleep or delirium. As if in response, my father raises\nhis upturned palms and says She\u2019s right, it\u2019s a joke, giving voice to uncertainty and pain \u2013 the stable currencies\nof his faith.

The window glass moved with a copy of my face when I looked at it.\nHis last breath was long, the exhalation silent. When they came for him, he might have been someone\nstill expecting company \u2013 his open hands and mouth, the comb-lines in his hair. He left the room on a false shelf\nunder a trolley laid out with towels, the woman steering him pretending that this was nothing more\nthan laundry being taken down in the lift.",

Linking stars\nand smears of low, transparent cloud,\nyou find a wound in the side\nof an overripe fig; a lizard,\nits position on a stone betrayed\nonly when it blinks. But then,\na tennis ball clears the fence,\na player laughs, and your parents return,\nsmelling of sweat and cigarettes.\nWhen they ask why you\u2019re up so late;\nwhat you\u2019re doing outside the car;\nyou\u2019ve not the words for what you know.\nOn the way home, you lie down\nand stare at the backs of their heads, which are dark, then silver\nin the lights of an overtaking lorry.\nYour father turns the radio off.\nYour mother turns to look at him.\nThey do not speak. You touch yourself\nunder the blankets, carefully,\nand forget about death for awhile.\nWhen the backs of their heads\nflare again, you promise yourself\nyou\u2019ll remember that moment;\nand you do, thirty-two years later,\nsitting up in bed, when your wife\u2019s face is lit by a car pulling into the drive.\nIn the dark again, you sense her\nglance at you. The glance returned,\nyou ask if she remembers\nhow old she was, or what she was doing\nwhen her first thoughts of death arrived.\nWhen she doesn\u2019t answer, you say\nStar, fig, lizard, and wait for the lights\nof another car to print\nthe shadows of your heads on the wall.",

  "text": "\u00a0 1 The road to Karekare In the middle of our journey\nwe found ourselves lost.\n\u2018This is the jungle,\u2019 said Johnny.\nRose asked if we had a map.\n\u2018Not a road map,\u2019 said Simon.\n\u2018So what sort do you have?\u2019\nWe looked for a life map. In the middle of the journey\nof my life, I sat on one side\nof Elvira and Rose sat\non the other. I have known\nElvira for sixteen months\nsince she was born,\nRose for sixteen years. At Karekare Rose and I\nleft the children to walk\nthe length of the beach.\n\u2018What was it like?\u2019 she asked.\nIt was like a dark wood.\nWe walked across sand\nnext to water, under sky. We walked back to the car\nacross the dunes and through\na wood of cabbage trees.\nJohnny said, \u2018Be quiet\nor the wild things will hear.\u2019\nThere might have been a leopard.\nThere were dogs. 2 My friendship with Dante Lost in the dark wood I want\nto rekindle my affair with the sun.\nI look about for my stiletto-heeled\nblack leather boots to put on. It is too dark to see. Three beasts stand between the sun and me.\nSimon, Johnny and Elvira stand at the top of the hill\nand howl at me. \u2018We are baby panthers.\u2019\nElvira howls at the sight\nof my wool work coat.\nI can?t get past. But out of the obscurity emerges the figure of a man,\nweak, as if his lungs have been still too long.\nIt is Dante, of course.\nDante! Can\u2019t you take me to the sun? But Dante has to take me first along the path\nhe once was led along by Virgil.\nAnother poet will take you to the sun.\n\u2018Frank O\u2019Hara knows the sun well\nand knows the way to Paradise.\nBut I can show you the way to hell.\u2019 And so to escape the three beasts\nI take Dante by the hand.\nWhen he moves on, I move on close\nbehind. 3 Into darkness Dante\u2019s cantos are \u2018missiles for capturing\nthe future\u2019. But they lead me\ninto the dark. But I am not Ciardi! Mandelbaum!\nBarely published! My friendship\nwith Mayakovsky is my sole\nclaim to fame.\nCan I translate the Inferno, knowing\nno Italian? \u2018Oh, come on. I am doing this for Frank\nand Emily Dickinson and all the other\npoets of the sun. They recognise you\nand even I picked you in the dark.\nWhy delay?\u2019 And just as flowers rise again\nfrom their night postures\nwhen the sun drives into their stems,\nI too stand tall. Where Dante goes I will follow after.\nI start on the road to hell. 4 I meet up with the spineless Now what comes next is not all good to tell\nand I\u2019m sorry to put you through it\nbut for the sake of those who will call this present\nthe olden days I\u2019ll let those present resent\nme and write on. Dante smiles as he leads me through the gates,\nand as I read the fearful words carved there\nhe slides an arm familiarly around my shoulders\nlike a heavy ray of sunshine. And here are those who were too cool to speak.\nSo this is where you ended up\nwhen I vomited you out of my mouth!\nI recognise you but I will name no names. Yet.\nI am tired at the thought of you.

  "text": "The Long Road to Teatime: Part 3 10  Over the valley of the therapists to the soup bowl of the malicious Gently Dante takes my hand and guides me off my furry fish,to lead me now up a rocky path and across a bridgeover a deep valley, long and narrow like a throat,swallowing down huge tongues of flame.This is the valley of bad therapists, who are hiddenin the flames of guilt that consume themfor the harm their wrong advice has caused. But now I?m stuck, because who could describe, even in prose,the pain suffered by those in the next level of hell?Language isn?t big enough. Here the troublemakers who caused discord when they were alive,who made friends fall out and who split families,are themselves splitand split, slicedby blades,bleeding,screaming,sliced and splitand split again butstill one, to be slicedagain and again and again sliced.  The screaming cuts through me till I cry out,Hellish blender make soupof them, make soup! Make soup! 11  Soberly we move on to the lowest levels of hell This part is even harder for me to tell.My stomach is cold with nerves,I write with a grip on my face. We have reached the levels where the treacherous plunge after death.Dante leads me down past the traitors to their countrybut when we reach the traitors to their familieshe stops, and when he stops I stop with him. Here are the parents who betrayed their children,who turned away from the good in themto complain about them to their friends,who saw their children as obstaclesto their own rewards. Screaming with horror they are forcing the childreninto their gaping mouths, and the air is thickwith the smell of their children?s bloodrunning down their chins, drenching their clothes,pooling at their feet. I am retching, retching, dry mouthed.I am terrified Dante will leave me here,but speechlessly he leads me on. 12  Impossibly, he takes me down still further Now we are truly at the bottom of the Inferno.There are no flames here.We walk across ice. My feet skate over the ice and my attention skatesover the horrors of the bottom level. I thinkI know my place. But Dante nods at me to look downwardsand I look below my feet to seethose frozen below the ground. It is impossible to speak to these figures,sealed in ice, their postures distorted. I open my mouth to ask Dante who they are,but no words come. Then I know these are the traitors to their calling.Here the artists who gave up painting, the poetswho were too busy teaching, are sealedin their silence. ?Take me away,? I whisper with all the breath I can raiseto my mouth. ?Take me away, I am still alive.? ?Ah, this is the one level of hell where the souls of the living are interredwhile their bodies still go through the motions on earth.?  13  Out the other side  The moment stretches to include eternitylike Emily Dickinson moments do.My heartbeat is an endless dash. Then time returns to the Inferno and races through dawn to dusk.Gravity turns inside out, our heads stand where our feet stood,and our feet are already walking down a hidden road. Dante moves on and I move on close behindtill we see a seamless hole ahead of us,and through the hole I see the earth holding the sky and the sky holding tight to the stars.",

  "text": "The Long Road to Teatime: Part 2 5  I wake up amongst the lustful gluttons I wake up and at first I think I am back on Ponsonby Road.A greasy cheesy smell of food thickens the airtill I lift my feet. Then another smell stirsand rises from the ground, a smell of rotting meatand fruit scraps turning slimily to earth.The slime seems bottomless underfootbut is so thick with its own stench it supports my weight. The restaurants all spill onto the footpath,drunken customers lurch out and lie in the gutterpressing their lips slackly on each other?s mouths.They eat in the gutter where they lie as if it doesn?t matterwhen they vomit over each otherbetween bites. Their mindless moans and shoutsclash with the discordant music all about. Seeing me some look up from their brawlingand copulation. Jade wants to knowif Greg is still alive. As more rubbish fallson our sodden spattered clothesshe begs me to speak of her to allthose left living, then lurches from her stoolto heave her guts out in the road. 6  Pain hosts the party the romantics cannot leave Pain offers me a glass of winebut I still feel sick from the level above.Someone takes my arm, pulls me downto a sofa. ?I have so much to tell you,?she whispers in a breathy voice.?Lisa? Is it you?? It is too dark to see. ?What are you doing here? Why is it so dark??I ask. The guests are crammed into the smallestkitchen of any party I?ve been toand there is no door out.Such a small kitchento hold such large anguish.Everyone is sobbingand smoking. I become aware of Nik melded to Lisa?s side.I can?t hear what Lisa is saying, she is sobbingso loud. Something about readingromances together till they werecrammed into the narrowest one andtheir vision shrank to its sizeand all went black. Then pain returns to my side, bringing pity, who comes between me and Lisa,offering salted peanutsand smalltalk. 7  So far the sinners have merely been incontinent and it takes a boat ride to the big cityto reach the usurers in their slime. Here they are with the murderers and homicides.The usurers too are in for violence,they have violated nature and artby investing their hopes in roads and commerce. There are too many names to name.Gloss this canto with the stockbrokers of your time. 8  I am reaquainted with the furry fish of fraud I remember my surprise eight years agowhen I looked under the downy fluff of Micky?s sweet talkand saw the scales of fraud beneath. It is this furry fish Dante urges me onto now.I climb on and off it flies, out into thin air.I look down and hastily shut my eyesbut I can?t shut out the screamingfrom those below me in the flames. I feel like Icarus must have felt, feeling his sides unfeatheringas the wax began to melt and nothing,nothing held him up. Remembering the freefall from my romance,I cling on tightly now to the fishy fur. 9  The flatterers still teem with language in the maze of stinking ditches where we land.They can?t see each other over the putrid wallsand though they reach out with their voicestheir sugared words stick to them like glue. I won?t look for Micky, his hair like candyfloss.I bury my face in my furry fish.

  "text": "6 It was no madman who gardened and farmed lifelong,\nMaking green the valley,\nPloughing and sowing the unbroken hill,\nLaying out fields, setting byre and barn,\nPlanted pine-belts, raised stone walls\nTo run like natural boundary marks\nOf hollow and terrace and rounded slope;\nWalls that stand and run\nBoulders, hill-stones, grey everlasting, rough-marbled\nMarking out place and time, separating\nField from field, life from life;\nVanishing over the flank of a spur,\nMelting into drifts of night\nOr cloud, or winter snow;\nMoving beyond known years and lives\nAcross the hill-face, round the sheer globe\nFar into memory, myth;\nCarefully, lovingly raised, stone by chosen stone\nDay after day, year on year,\nA lifetime burden of stones,\nA history hewn of silent walls. 7 Moving higher at length\nHe left field and wall behind,\nLooking down at them, looking beyond them\nTo town and harbour, and farther yet\nSwart-green headlands, white beaches\nAnd the sombre arc of ocean\nUnheard except on still nights after storm,\nBut always present, the oncoming night\nWaiting, the end of time waiting;\nCold ocean, grave of waters\nAnd the world\u2019s burial ground. 8 Few passed his door,\nNone crossed his mind.\nAt home in summer air\nAnd railing wind\nHe lived out day and night\nAs though none but he\nTrod earth\u2019s deck, beset\nBy sea and sky. 9 The town clacked, mocked, forgot, was reminded.\nAn old man on the mountain\nHe had no right there\nSetting himself up against\nDecent folk in houses.\nIt didn\u2019t do anyone good to think of him,\nOld men should not live alone\n\u2013 It wasn\u2019t right for anybody\nTo live like that alone.\nWhy, he might die there one day all by himself\nAnd no one be any wiser.\nAnd some think the town neglected him\nWhich would give it an ill name \u2013\nLike the bad names the old man threw\nAt the passer-by or visitor\nWho gave him a friendly word, proffered a kindness. But, live and let live,\nNo one was looking for trouble,\nIt wouldn\u2019t be wise to use force\nUnless it was needed. 10 They found him when his strength failed,\nCarried him down at last\nTired beyond protesting.\nAnd the town received him,\nNursed him barely a week,\nUntil death shook\nHis leaf from the bough,\nOut of then, into now. ?Ben Rudd? was first published in Landfall 44 (December 1597). Brasch revised it for Ambulando (1964). But Brasch?s recording contains some variants from each version and some from neither.",

I was six years old. I wore white shirt & brown shorts with white socks and I hopped in my sandals. There was a white bob sewed onto my seat. We made our appearance in the wake of pixies who danced with farmers, who sang a song which was applauded by the parents & friends of the school. I\u2019m leading up only to the confession: my shorts burst their seams. We had been applauded enthusiastically as we emerged from the dark perimeter of the one-room school\u2019s long garden. Now I was assailed with the infectious laughter that escapes from numerous hand-sealed mouths. I was the last rabbit to hop across the infinite expanse of the dewy lawn. My mother caught me as I lost my way. Upon my belated exit, legitimate applause swelled up once more.",

  "text": "S Ancient of Days, old friend, no one believes you\u2019ll come back.\nNo one believes in his own life anymore. The moon, like a dead heart, cold and unstartable, hangs by a thread\nAt the earth\u2019s edge,\nUnfaithful at last, splotching the ferns and the pink shrubs. In the other world, children undo the knots in their tally strings.\nThey sing songs, and their fingers blear. And here, where the swan hums in his socket, where bloodroot\nAnd belladonna insist on our comforting,\nWhere the fox in the canyon wall empties our hands, ecstatic for more, Like a bead of clear oil the Healer revolves through the night wind,\nPart eye, part tear, unwilling to recognize us.",

  "text": "Ben Rudd 1 High above the town\nHe lodged with wind and sun\nIn a hollow of the hill\nWhose tussock arms fell\nAbout him, streams ran by\nLow-voiced night and day. Narrow hut and black hearth\nCrouching to earth,\nBilly, bunk and crude\nBench, axe and spade,\nCandle and shotgun \u2013\nAnd the flag of green\nOutside by the brown wall,\nPotato patch and full-\nFruited raspberry, gooseberry. 2 No one crossed his door,\nNo one crossed his path\nFor fear\nOf sudden threat or oath. And yet his single care\nWas to keep at bay\nAll who might interfere\nComing to pry \u2013 The righteous who would trick\nHim to their lawless town\nAnd hold him lost and weak\nTo waste among men Far from hill and sky;\nSo, helpless to run,\nWhen words were thrown away\nHe seized his gun. 3 \u2018Up there on the mountain\u2019, they said,\n\u2018Half crazed, not right in the head,\nDangerous too, pointing his gun\nFor no reason, at anyone\nPassing, not stopping even \u2013\nThat\u2019s what he\u2019s come to, living\nAlone in the wind and sun,\nOld, and his wits gone;\nIt\u2019s not right,\u2019 they said,\n\u2018Alone there, muttering mad\nWords, mad old Ben Rudd.\u2019 4 Start alone, end alone. All known faces gone\nAnd familiar talk done;\nHeart that poised on a knife edge\nEased now of stubborn rage,\nBeyond fear and hope content\nNot to ask, not to want,\nFree to live its own days\nWasting no breath upon the ways\nOf other men, but every thought\nBent to work the sum out\nOf what is and what is not. 5 \u2018Ben Rudd, mad Ben Rudd\nSoft in the head\nThinks himself God!\u2019\nThe town boys cried out\nRacing past his hut. Angry looks, a black\nWord flung in their wake,\nGun snatched up \u2013\nBut they were gone sharp\nDown among boulder and bush\nInto the evening hush\nAnd on to the smug town,\nSwelling the rumour spread\nOf mad Ben Rudd.

One tilts back a foreshortened face\nAnd gazes upwards in a trance\nTowards the ring of stars that trace\nUpon his eye their ritual dance. The circling clowns upon the hill\nBehold the wheeling fires of space\nAnd moving at an equal pace\nSee them stand still. And yet more giddy grows the dance\nThe dancers separate and sprawl\nAnd lying prostrate on the grass\nStare upwards at the starry wheel.",

Out there, down here, something is amiss:\nFlood takes a town, grenades kill a child,\nWhat has been will be, what might be is,\nThe nations rage and the desert runs wild. Somehow our future, age or violence,\nMeasured by clocks or strata, mirrors there\nFor stargazers to see with instruments\nThe white-patched poles, the dust, the thinning air. II\nMars ascends in golden armour\nVenus in shell of dark lies sleeping\nChildren gaze at night-sky window Children in their beds lie sleeping\nMars unbars the shining window\nVenus unpins the golden armour Venus clouds the curtained window\nMars now in her lap lies sleeping\nChildren steal the golden armour.

The desiccated blond inspects\nThe pages of her Baedeker,\nHoping that somehow culture and sex\nAt last will coalesce for her.\nShe who through Europe has pursued\nDelight still missed en troisi me noce,\nBeneath some vast exuberant nude\nOf Rubens, knows the pain of loss. Fading with cup and mandolin,\nGoya?s country feast turns dark,\nBut soon the firing-squads begin\nBy lanternlight their bloody work.\nBefore that last anger and despair\nAt human folly, someone stands.\nIt is oneself that cannot bear\nThose anguished eyes and famished hands. Velazquez turns with easy stance\nTo the princess and the maids of honour,\nCaught in a movement like a dance,\nAnd calms the dwarf\u2019s indignant humour.\nRoyalty in the looking glass\nFears its heavy image less:\nThe gift of water in a glass\nForgives the human ugliness. Equal and intellectual,\nTranscending flesh, transcending flame,\nThis passionless light that hallows all\nShall build us an eternal home.",

An old church and two crooked streets,\nA guesthouse solid as a farm,\nA whitewashed room floored with blue tile,\nRed blankets and coarse sundried sheets\nAnd the cool darkness lying calm\nOutside the window, mile on mile. The tattered piper stands and blows\nA kind of fanfare or salute\nUpon his pipe of polished cane;\nThen, changing key, the music flows\nLike water from that pastoral flute\nThrough sleepy valleys of the brain. Above the shadow of the hills\nIberian stars are mildly bright,\nThe new moon lifts out of a cloud,\nAnd the long hollow valley fills\nWith milk of phosphorescent light\nAnd the piper\u2019s music sweet and loud. The agile melancholy tune\nWinds and unwinds its varying stream\nInside and outside of the mind.\nThe sense dissolves. Somewhere the moon\nIs slowly sinking in a dream\nWhere travellers set out to find Some antique scene of living rock,\nOf horsemen tall on the hillside,\nOf armoured ghosts upon the march\nAnd gods in trees. The minstrel cock\nStrikes up; galactic darkness rides\nUnder the sky\u2019s triumphal arch.",

The two of them loved to bicker In a way that on his side went back to Yiddish,\nOn Sandra\u2019s to some Sicilian dialect.\nHe used to scold her endlessly for smoking. When she got back from dinner with their children\nThe doctors had to tell them about the mistake.\nOh swirling petals, falling leaves! The movement Of linking renga coursing from moment to moment\nIs meaning, Bob says in his Haiku book.\nOh swirling petals, all living things are contingent, Falling leaves, and transient, and they suffer.\nBut the Universal is the goal of jokes,\nEspecially certain ethnic jokes, which taper Down through the swirling funnel of tongues and gestures\nToward their preposterous Ithaca. There\u2019s one\nA journalist told me. He heard it while a hero Of the South African freedom movement was speaking\nTo elderly Jews. The speaker\u2019s own right arm\nHad been blown off by right-wing letter-bombers. He told his listeners they had to cast their ballots\nFor the ANC \u2013 a group the old Jews feared\nAs \u201cin with the Arabs.\u201d But they started weeping As the old one-armed fighter told them their country\nNeeded them to vote for what was right, their vote\nCould make a country their children could return to From London and Chicago. The moved old people\nApplauded wildly, and the speaker\u2019s friend\nWhispered to the journalist, \u201cIt\u2019s the Belgian Army Joke come to life.\u201d I wish that I could tell it\nTo Elliot. In the Belgian Army, the feud\nBetween the Flemings and Walloons grew vicious, So out of hand the army could barely function.\nFinally one commander assembled his men\nIn one great room, to deal with things directly. They stood before him at attention. \u201cAll Flemings,\u201d\nHe ordered, \u201cto the left wall.\u201d Half the men\nClustered to the left. \u201cNow all Walloons,\u201d he ordered, \u201cMove to the right.\u201d An equal number crowded\nAgainst the right wall. Only one man remained\nAt attention in the middle: \u201cWhat are you, soldier?\u201d Saluting, the man said, \u201cSir, I am a Belgian.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, that\u2019s astonishing, Corporal \u2013 what\u2019s your name?\u201d\nSaluting again, \u201cRabinowitz,\u201d he answered: A joke that seems at first to be a story\nAbout the Jews. But as the renga describes\nReligious meaning by moving in drifting petals And brittle leaves that touch and die and suffer\nThe changing winds that riffle the gutter swirl,\nSo in the joke, just under the raucous music Of Fleming, Jew, Walloon, a courtly allegiance\nMoves to the dulcimer, gavotte and bow,\nOver the banana tree the moon in autumn \u2013 Allegiance to a state impossible to tell.",

  "text": "\u00a0 The navy from Tarshish arrives with gold and silver,\nivory, apes, and Peacock, with his hundred eyes. King Solomon brings his children and his hundred wives.\nStretching a mile or so long, they line up on the wharf to view the strange barbaric throng. Peacock assumes\nthe reception is for him and almost manages a song. Peahen, ignored by everyone, dutifully following in his\nrhythm, carries the suitcases and a flagon of smelling salts. Peacock marches up and down and struts\nhis stuff and preens. Until he fluffs his tail and careens to the limit of his pride. It is then that Peahen rushes\nto his side and hisses in her quiet voice: \u2018Feet! Feet!\u2019 Peacock, as if stung, whimpers and in retreat lowers\nhis head in shame. Pride falls like his eyes to the ground and his ugly black feet. Peahen unstoppers the smelling\nsalts and delivers it neat. Peahen does not consider herself cruel, or, as some would have it, consumed by\njealousy. Oh no, she says, it\u2019s just that a woman\u2019s got to protect the one who puts bread on the table, even from\nhimself. Nobody looking at him (she says) would suppose his brain to be the size of a pea, his head so light, all that\narrests his fancy, or even more permanent flight is his wife, me, having to remind him every time, of those ugly\nblack feet. The only thing that keeps him grounded and in line.",

A mile out in the marshes, under a sky\nWhich seems to be always going away\nIn a hurry, on that Venetian land threaded\nWith hidden canals, you will find the city\nWhich seconds ours (so cemeteries, too,\nReflect a town from hillsides out of town),\nWhere Being most Becomingly ends up\nBecoming some more. From cardboard tenements,\nWindowed with cellophane, or simply tenting\nIn paper bags, the angry mackerel eyes\nGlare at you out of stove-in, sunken heads\nFar from the sea; the lobster, also, lifts\nAn empty claw in his most minatory\nOf gestures; oyster, crab, and mussel shells\nLie here in heaps, savage as money hurled\nAway at the gate of hell. If you want results,\nThese are results.\nObjects of value or virtue,\nHowever, are also to be picked up here,\nThough rarely, lying with bones and rotten meat,\nEggshells and mouldy bread, banana peels\nNo one will skid on, apple cores that caused\nNeither the fall of man nor a theory\nOf gravitation. People do throw out\nThe family pearls by accident, sometimes,\nNot often; I\u2019ve known dealers in antiques\nTo prowl this place by night, with flashlights, on\nThe off-chance of somebody\u2019s having left\nDerelict chairs which will turn out to be\nby Hepplewhite, a perfect set of six\nGoing to show, I guess, that in any sty\nSomeone\u2019s heaven may open and shower down\nRiches responsive to the right dream; though\nIt is a small chance, certainly, that sends\nThe ghostly dealer, heavy with fly-netting\nOver his head, across these hills in darkness,\nStumbling in cut-glass goblets, lacquered cups,\nAnd other products of his dreamy midden\nPenciled with light and guarded by the flies. For there are flies, of course. A dynamo\nComposed, by thousands, of our ancient black\nRetainers, hums here day and night, steady\nAs someone telling beads, the hum becoming\nA high whine at any disturbance; then,\nSettled again, they shine under the sun\nLike oil-drops, or are invisible as night,\nBy night.\nAll this continually smoulders,\nCrackles, and smokes with mostly invisible fires\nWhich, working deep, rarely flash out and flare,\nAnd never finish. Nothing finishes;\nThe flies, feeling the heat, keep on the move. Among the flies, the purefying fires,\nThe hunters by night, acquainted with the art\nOf our necessities, and the new deposits\nThat each day wastes with treasure, you may say\nThere should be ratios. You may sum up\nThe results, if you want results. But I will add\nThat wild birds, drawn to the carrion and flies,\nAssemble in some numbers here, their wings\nShining with light, their flight enviably free,\nTheir music marvelous, though sad, and strange.",

  "text": "Still half drunk, after a night at cards,\nwith the grey dawn taking us unaware\namong our guilty kings and queens, we drove\nfar North in the morning, winners, losers,\nto a stream in the high hills, to climb up to a place\none of us knew, with some vague view\nof cutting losses or consolidating gains\nby the old standard appeal to the wilderness,\nthe desert, the empty places of our exile,\nbringing only the biblical bread and cheese\nand cigarettes got from a grocer\u2019s on the way,\nexpecting to drink only the clear cold water\namong the stones, and remember, or forget.\nThough no one said anything about atonement,\nthere was still some purgatorial idea\nin all those aching heads and ageing hearts\nas we climbed the giant stair of the stream,\nreaching the place around noon. It was as promised, a wonder, with granite walls\nenclosing ledges, long and flat, of limestone,\nor, rolling, of lava; within the ledges\nthe water, fast and still, pouring its yellow light,\nand green, over the tilted slabs of the floor,\nblackened at shady corners, falling in a foam\nof crystal to a calm where the waterlight\ndappled the ledges as they leaned\nagainst the sun; big blue dragonflies hovered\nand darted and dipped a wing, hovered again\nagainst the low wind moving over the stream,\nand shook the flakes of light from their clear wings.\nThis surely was it, was what we had come for,\nwas nature, though it looked like art with its\ngrey fortress walls and laminated benches\nas in the waiting room of some petrified station.\nBut we believed; and what it was we believed\nmade of the place a paradise\nfor ruined poker players, win or lose,\nwho stripped naked and bathed and dried out on the rocks\nlike gasping trout (the water they drank\nmaking them drunk again), lit cigarettes and lay back\nwaiting for nature to say the last word\n\u2013 as though the stones were Memnon stones,\nwhich, caught in a certain light, would sing. The silence (and even the noise of the waters\nwas silence) grew pregnant; that is the phrase,\ngrew pregnant; but nothing else did.\nThe mountains brought forth not a mouse, and the rocks,\nunlike the ones you would expect to find\non the slopes of Purgatory or near Helicon,\nmollified by muses and with a little give to \u2019em,\nwere modern American rocks, and hard as rocks.\nOur easy bones groaned, our flesh baked\non one side and shuddered on the other; and each man\nthought bitterly about primitive simplicity\nand decadence, and how he had been ruined\nby civilization and forced by circumstances\nto drink and smoke and sit up all night\ninspecting those perfectly arbitrary cards\nuntil he was broken-winded as a trout on a rock\nand had no use for the doctrines of Jean Jacques\nRousseau, and could no longer afford\na savagery whether noble or not; some\nwould never batter that battered copy of Walden\nagain. But all the same,\nthe water, the sunlight, and the wind\ndid something; even the dragonflies\ndid something to the minds full of telephone\nnumbers and flushes, to the flesh\nsweating bourbon on one side and freezing on the other.\nAnd the rocks, the old and tumbling boulders\nwhich formed the giant stair of the stream,\ninduced (again) some purgatorial ideas\nconcerning humility, concerning patience\nand enduring what had to be endured,\nwinning and losing and breaking even;\nideas of weathering in whatever weather,\nbeing eroded, or broken, or ground down into pebbles\nby the stream\u2019s necessitous and grave currents.\nBut to these ideas did any purgatory\nrespond? Only this one: that in a world\nwhere even the Memnon stones were carved in soap\none might at any rate wash with the soap. After a time we talked about the War,\nabout what we had done in the War, and how near\nsome of us had been to being drowned, and burned,\nand shot, and how many people we knew\nwho had been drowned, or burned, or shot;\nand would it have been better to have died\nin the War, the peaceful old War, where we were young?\nBut the mineral peace, or paralysis, of those\ngreat stones, the moving stillness of the waters,\nentered our speech; the ribs and blood\nof the earth, from which all fables grow,\nestablished poetry and truth in us,\nso that at last one said, \u201cI shall play cards\nuntil the day I die,\u201d and another said,\n\u201cin bourbon whisky are all the vitamins\nand minerals needed to sustain man\u2019s life,\u201d\nand still another, \u201cI shall live on smoke\nuntil my spirit has been cured of flesh.\u201d Climbing downstream again, on the way home\nto the lives we had left empty for a day,\nwe noticed, as not before, how of three bridges\nnot one had held the stream, which in its floods\nhad twisted the girders, splintered the boards, hurled\nboulder on boulder, and had broken into rubble,\nsmashed practically back to nature,\nthe massive masonry of span after span\nwith its indifferent rage; this was a sight\nthat sobered us considerably, and kept us quiet\nboth during the long drive home and after,\ntill it was time to deal the cards.",

But where does it go to really, he wonders,\nor come back from;\nis this all resurrection means,\na flicker of cells, a taste for symmetry?\nDrop a dimension, and what was it all about?\nHis irony\u2019s nervous tic is a grey shortcut: two hesitations er er\nin a declaration of love,\nthe question-answer in a mock debate,\nor less, the single quote marks either end\nof an anecdote with a lame punchline \u2013\n\u2018two dark wings that could not lift our bird to flight\u2019.

Though to\nhold on in any case means taking less and less\nfor granted, some few things seem nearly\ncertain, as that the longest day will come again, will seem to hold its breath,\nthe months-long exhalation of diminishment\nagain begin. Last night you woke me\nfor a look at Jupiter, that vast cinder wheeled unblinking\nin a bath of galaxies. watching, we traveled\ntoward an apprehension all but impossible\nto be held onto that no point is fixed, that there\u2019s no foothold\nbut roams untethered save by such snells,\nsuch sailor\u2019s knots, such stays\nand guy wires as are mainly of our own devising. From such an\nempyrean, aloof seraphic mentors urge us\nto look down on all attachment,\non any bonding, as in the end untenable. Base as it is, from\nyear to year the earth\u2019s sore surface\nmends and rebinds itself, however\nand as best it can, with thread of cinquefoil, tendril of the magenta\nbeach pea, trammel of bramble; with easings,\nmulchings, fragrances, the gray-green\nbayberry\u2019s cool poultice \u2013 and what can\u2019t finally be mended, the salt air\nproceeds to buff and rarefy: the lopped carnage\nof the seaward spruce clump weathers\nlustrous, to wood-silver. Little is certain, other than the tide that\ncircumscribes us, that still sets its term\nto every picnic \u2013 today we stayed too long\nagain, we got our feet wet \u2013 and all attachment may prove at best, perhaps\na broken, a much-mended thing. Watching the longest day take cover under\na monk\u2019s-cowl overcast, with thunder, rain and wind, then waiting,\nwe drop everything to listen as a\nhermit thrush distills its fragmentary,\nhesitant, in the end unbroken music. From what source (beyond us, or\nthe wells within?) such links perceived arrive \u2013\ndiminished sequences so uninsistingly\nnot even human \u2013 there\u2019s hardly a vocabulary left to wonder, uncertain\nas we are of so much in this existence, this\nbotched, cumbersome, much-mended,\nnot unsatisfactory thing.",

He stood so still\nwe didn\u2019t exist. There was nothing real\nbut that slither of negatives at his feet.",

How many beasts\nDied to provide him with meat, belt and shoes\nCannot be certainly said.\nBut anyhow,\nIt is in this way that a man travels through time,\nLeaving behind him a lengthening trail\nOf empty bottles and bones, of broken shoes,\nFrayed collars and worn out or outgrown\nDiapers and dinnerjackets, silk ties and slickers. Given the energy and security thus achieved,\nHe did . . . ? What? The usual things, of course,\nThe eating, dreaming, drinking and begetting,\nAnd he worked for the money which was to pay\nFor the eating, et cetera, which were necessary\nIf he were to go on working for the money, et cetera,\nBut chiefly he talked. As the bottles and bones\nAccumulated behind him, the words proceeded\nSteadily from the front of his face as he\nAdvanced into the silence and made it verbal.\nWho can tally the tale of his words? A lifetime\nWould barely suffice for their repetition;\nIf you merely printed all his commas the result\nWould be a very large volume, and the number of times\nHe said \u201cthank you\u201d or \u201cvery little sugar, please,\u201d\nWould stagger the imagination. There were also\nWitticisms, platitudes, and statements beginning\n\u201cIt seems to me\u201d or \u201cAs I always say.\u201d\nConsider the courage in all that, and behold the man\nWalking into deep silence, with the ectoplastic\nCartoon\u2019s balloon of speech proceeding\nSteadily out of the front of his face, the words\nBorne along on the breath which is his spirit\nTelling the numberless tale of his untold Word\nWhich makes the world his apple, and forces him to eat.",

And soon as I heard this fact I immediately thought of quite a few things that I wouldn\u2019t mind if my friend just happened to drop into the conversation, and so I started to make a list of those things planning to ring the friend and say \u2018make sure you mention all these things\u2019.

Say that serenity and grace\nHave taken root inside me.\nMy top-note is frivolity\nBut beneath, dark passions guide me.\nTell him I\u2019m radiant and replete\nAnd add that everyday it\nSeems I am harder to resist.\nDon\u2019t say I said to say it. Tell him that all my ancient faults\nHave been eradicated.\nI do not carp or analyse\nAs I might have when we dated.\nSay I\u2019m not bossy any more\nOr, better still, convey it\nSubtly, but get the point across.\nDon\u2019t say I said to say it.",

A bramble rough path ran to the river\nWhere you stepped carefully across slime-topped stones,\nWith corners abraded as bleakly white as bones. At the widening pool (for washing and cattle)\nMinute fish flickered as you dipped,\nCircling to fill, with rust-tinged water. The second or enamel bucket was for spring water\nWhich, after racing through a rushy meadow,\nCame bubbling in a broken drain-pipe, Corroded wafer thin with rust.\nIt ran so pure and cold, it fell\nLike manacles of ice on the wrists. You stood until the bucket brimmed\nInhaling the musty smell of unpicked berries,\nThat heavy greenness fostered by water. Recovering the scene, I had hoped to stylize it,\nLike the portrait of an Egyptian water-carrier:\nBut pause, entranced by slight but memoried life. I sometimes come to take the water there,\nNot as return or refuge, but some pure thing,\nSome living source, half-imagined and half-real, Pulses in the fictive water that I feel.",

No Diving Running Eating Smiling\nShare if lanes are busy.\nPerhaps, perhaps, perhaps. The waiting crowd are all, like me,\nup early talking or silent,\nmore vivacious than galahs,\nmore foolish than parrots. We stand and wait, walk up and down\nin the rain talking or not, holding\nin sagging muscle, spreading paunch,\ntalking about things that must matter.\nSo much seems to hang on\ngetting in that door.",

As we stayed in the wood, hidden,\nwe heard the sound system below us\ncalling the winners at Chepstow,\nfaint as the breeze turned. The sun came out on us, the shade blotches\nwent hazel: we heard names\nbubble like stock-doves over the woods as jockeys in stained silks gentled\nthose sweat-dark, shuddering horses\ndown to the walk.",

They are a daughterly indulgence, gear\nTo stir the sluggish pumps and muscles of our fifties,\nMythical as the breath they need, and tan knees. Not these, which seem a flattering novelty,\nBut a letter found later in a dusty trunk\nBrings to mind all that I know of this game. Brings it back across a half century\nIn a cautious upper case and licked pencil\nThat once imagined Blackpool for Nairobi. The signifiers are elementary. I HAVE\nGOT A CUCLSHOC. I CAN HIT IT\n5 TIMS. What else do I remember? The cistern drip and chill of an attic Christmas.\nThe layered curves of the frames, strained maroon\nLike spills, and trussed with yellow woven gut. And the rattling thwung of the wobbly cork tub\nBound with its brittle stumps of varnished feathers\nThat however hard you hit it, slowed, and turned. It made me think of the parson\u2019s nose, all quills:\nWhen it wavered towards me over the washing-line\nIt was like getting ready to biff a chicken\u2019s bum. And if I missed, although it had stopped dead\nMysteriously in mid-air, it dropped just too quickly\nOut of my reach, like a newsreel commando. Whatever I might have known about adult love,\nAbout the sacred triviality of letters\nOr their conspiracy at a distance about presents, Whatever I suspected might be uncertain in the future,\nIn the size of oceans, the licensed irregularity\nOf wars and the accuracy of torpedoes, Cries out from these laborious sentences\nWith all their childish feeling and now with all\nMy later tears. I HOPE YOU WILL COM BACK SOON SO WE CAN HAVE SOM FUN. That winged basket,\nThat little lofted button, forever hovering,\nStill hangs in the back yard, beyond my racquet. The feathers are splayed in the sun, like the fragile words\nWe sometimes write and mean, which therefore always\nMean and always will be there to do so. SEND A FOTORGAF OF YOR SELF. It glints\nWith the stitching of angels, buoyant in the light,\nNever falling. WELL WELL GOOD BY DADDY DEAR.",

We were licking the cream\nfrom the universal ice. Words foundered and cracked.\nHow the bonnet was warm on your bottom! And the metal\ncontinued tick-ticking though the engine was off. And the evening shuddered, since everything is connected.\nI was licking the cream from the universal saucer.\nI was all of Cheshire and points between.\nYou saw the great sky turn blacker, you saw the spray of stars\nand your hair got tangled in the windscreen wiper. At the hot ponds we stripped as night closed in.\nI secretly admired your underwear, your long\nelusive legs. In the spring where we lay side by side\nwe held hands. Up above the steam the sky. I said\nThat one is called Sirius or Dog Star, but only here on Earth.  And when since the stories foretold it we parted,\nthose birds were all released again. Such buoyancy.\nThey go on forever like that. How else to say thank you\nin a foreign place? We are ever in the arms of our exile,\nforever going one way and the other though sometimes of course on a sphere that is not so bad.\nI will meet you on the nape of your neck one day,\non the surface of intention, word becoming act.\nWe will breathe into each other the high mountain tales,\nwhere the snows come from, where the waters begin. In the yellow time of pollen when the fields were ablaze\nwe were very near bewildered by beauty.\nThe sky was a god-bee that hummed. All the air boomed\nwith that thunder. It was both for the prick\nand the nectar we drank that we gave ourselves over. And if every step taken is a step well-lived but a foot\ntowards death, every pilgrimage a circle, every flight-path\nthe tracing of a sphere: I will give myself over and over.\nI have migrated through Carpathians of sorrow\nto myself heaped happy in the corner there. Nothing seemed strange in the world, you\u2019ll understand-\nnothing ever more would. Monkey Boy came to me saying\nLook-the moon of the moon.  The little one circled the big one.\nHe crouched in the palm of my hand, tiny, sincere,\npointing at the sky. There was something sad about him. The python was nothing, nothing at all, nothing\nbut strength shed to suppleness, nothing but will\nencased in itself. The python was a muscle of thought.\nCoiled and mute, in a place where nothing but rain fell,\nthe python thought: this is the beginning or end of the world. The python was everywhere, everywhere at once, aware\nonly too much of that ageless agony: its existence.\nI am tired, it said; and the stream burbled by.\nI am waiting for the recoil, the uncoil, coil of night,\ncoil of stars, coil of the coldness of the water. The python said Who are these people? \nThe whole city sweated, moved like a limb. The air\nfitted like a glove two sizes too small and too many\nsingers sang the banal. The bars roared all night.\nThe kite hawks grew ashamed. All nature squirmed.",

There we all are in the rise and fall,\nShocked but pleased with ourselves,\nWhen the engines start again.\nTrembling with naked bodies\nThe plane straightens out,\nWhich is what we all think we should do,\nMore than a trifle embarrassed,\nEspecially me and the elegant woman\nWho shows me a picture of two children,\nWaiting for Mummy at the airport. We all start to apologize,\nGoodness me, whatever got into us?\nIt\u2019s terrible what stress does,\nI won\u2019t be declaring this at customs.\nThen, always having been a little mad,\nCarrying a word or two in my old kitbag,\nI suggest we continue speechless activities\nIn an appropriate intimate manner.\nQuick as a flash we\u2019re at it again,\nAn entire plane of quivering bodies.

  "text": "\u00a0 The snaps are in black and white, of course,\nFew captions, the album-covers scuffed,\nBut Kitty and Joyce still smile their smiles\nFrom a speedboat tethered by stone steps\nIn what has the look of a Swiss lake.\nOne page on and Derek at a picnic\nStrains facetiously to draw a cork,\nAnd General Sawyer in dinner jacket\nPoses by the rear door of a Daimler.\n(It was he who without explanation\nIn a late codicil to his will\nLeft me an old-fashioned naval spyglass,\nPresumably for looking at stars.\nBut I have never been a stars person,\nPreferring to train my objective\nOn the bay windows across the townland.)\nHermione and Julius on a cruise\nFill several sheets ? games on the boat-deck\nAnd eager Arabs in djellabiyas\nPestering the tourists in Port Said.\nThen to badminton at Cowes, and drinks\nOn Graham\u2019s destroyer in the Solent. It was not like that \u2013 nor is it now \u2013\nIn New Ross or the herbaceous valleys\nThat trail down from Carlow and Kilkenny,\nWhere the livestock stand dumbly around\nUnder broad-leaved trees in the demesnes\nAnd the Nore slides swiftly over crowfoot.\nIn these parts there is not much call\nFor cigarette-holders or shady hats.\nThe creamery coughs from before dawn\nAnd all day the foreigners\u2019 meat lorries\nRumble and thud along the main street.\nThough I shoot with a couple of Councillors\nAnd the Principal of the Tech,\nA brace of woodcock is small return\nFor hours of damp shoulders and cold feet.\nBut asylum resides in the office ?\nVirginia-creepered, shabby but warm ?\nWhere my pink-cheeked secretary sits\nTyping out conveyances and wills.\nDrinking my morning coffee, I observe\nHer bosom snug in Botany wool\nAnd her reassuringly thick legs.",

Members of our tribe also fall,\nFar flung on the earth\u2019s wind.\nSome are locked in,\nSome locked out. Dreams burn,\nThe wheel turns. Dave returned to Maine,\nCustoms were perplexed as he stated\nHe was smuggling freedom.\nFreedom was his home. Flesh and bone are no armour against pain,\nWinter black trees in rain\nAs the world ripens\nOn the temper of its name. Words flowed like honey off our tongues,\nTravelers on the night road to Asia.\nWe were there in the streets,\nWe were there in the halls\nAs seasons changed\nAnd life rearranged. Ed went up a mountain to find truth.\nIt was said to lurk up there\nIn the form of an old man,\nBut he only found himself. I call them to this room for a moment:\nWayne, Nicholas, Jacqueline, Sue,\nSilent in the faces,\nDistant places.\nThe years are stealthy reminders\nThat we don\u2019t control the turn of events,\nInvited by rumour,\nWe are its guests. You, too, have your own names,\nReminding you of what you knew\nWhen you walked in the ruin\nOf splendid summers. Dreams burn,\nThe wheel turns. And so, we are all travelers, whatever the form of transport we might use at the time, or where we might travel in our mind. At this moment I am on a boat. Friends, I am a passenger at the rail.\nI am the believer.\nI am the doubter,\nWatching the moon return to the sea,\nHolding the faces of you who I have known,\nBriefly, as though singing in the place\nWhere dreams are born.\nI wait for the sun to raise the dawn.",

Responding to clients\nwith technical help, or arranging credit \u2013 The training takes three weeks,\nthen they throw us to the wolves.\nMostly clients are polite, but some feel free\nto pour their vitriol on me \u2013\nGee, I could show them how to curse \u2013 Behind me the buzz of the room and to one side\nthe boys in black, pale-skinned, lip-studded, blue hair,\nhunched over their laptops.\nThe network uses a software related to Oracle.\nIt\u2019s newly installed, the bugs are multiplying There\u2019s an error down in the PHP code, one says.\nI nod. Without ever knowing what the PHP code is,\nI will refer to it many times, on the phone to clients.\nOr I say, It\u2019s a case of link-rot. Don\u2019t worry about that.\nRight now we can extend you fifty dollars of calls. At Backpacker Central we cook a meal and\nmeet Beck who\u2019s selling wine by the case:\nthe hit rate\u2019s about three per cent.

Her boyfriend and his uncles\nare watching her. She\u2019s almost buried under\nthe wild pig, but it\u2019s a victory parade. When the uncles steal the boar, the boyfriend kills them \u2013\nand later in the play his mother, enraged,\nsince the uncles are her brothers \u2013\napproaches our fi re at the side of the stage.\nHubba hubba smoke and brooms. Will she defend her brothers, or her son?\nShe\u2019s carrying the wooden brand she\u2019d snatched\nfrom the fire the day her son was born. She saved\nhis life, then. Now she squats and brandishes\nher bit of trunk at our fire. At that time there were fifty of us, the kindly ones,\nyes be careful who you invoke. For us\na euphemism is best. EU means \u2018well\u2019 \u2013 think of the\neucalypt \u2013 the gumnut covers the seed \u2013 \u2018well-covered\u2019.\nEumenides, that\u2019s our other name. Happy when left alone but formal in our work,\ndefenders of justice, ideally practised in dissonance,\nwe\u2019re trained to provide revenge.\nDuring the drama we have come in slowly,\nstepping across the uncles\u2019 and the boar\u2019s blood. Silently now we surround the action in a circle.\nAt a break in the stricken monologue of the mother\nwe begin to keen and ululate, then Alecto\ngets on a half-note over mine, we make it piercing,\nMegaera turns into a bird. Above us in the tiers, two people faint.\nThe mother in the story then faces us \u2013\n\u2018Turn, ye Furies, goddesses of punishment \u2013 \u2018\nand we reel back, our song stopped. \u2018Turn\nto behold the sacrifice I bring.\u2019 We start to wail again, and waves of sound rise\nthrough the tiers. More people faint, three\nhave convulsions. The medics are called.\nThe following week Aeschylus is brought\nbefore the local magistrate. A lecture is read to him about public safety\nand he\u2019s told he can\u2019t have fi fty\nof these so-called kindly ones.\nYour Honour, he says, What number\ndo you think is possible? How will the mother punish her son?\nIn fact the mother has him killed \u2013 yes \u2013\nthat\u2019s how it ended. The childlike, the charming\nsociopath is not gaoled with colour TV and drugs\nor counselling. See the mother, whose brothers have been killed,\ncomes up to us and hesitates four times, then puts the brand\non the fire. This is the wood she plucked out when she saved\nher son\u2019s life. Silence. The fatal wood gives a groan,\nand he is breathed out to the wandering winds. Well, I\u2019m tired of vengeance now.\nOften I\u2019m away from home \u2013 this time when I left,\nit was with my sisters, after the tragedy festival.\nWhat we needed was a holiday, Alecto said,\nsomewhere completely different. On the way south,\nwe saw signs for an agricultural show.\nThe dusty carnival atmosphere blurred our eyes\nand during an unidentified lapse in time we shifted\nto a new language, a different territory. * We went into the halls of time,\ncobwebbed tunnels where dank plants loomed,\npast the river-caves\u2019 tacky monsters\nwhose ancestors\u2019 claws we\u2019ve pulled from our backs,\nthen above-ground we saw a sign for the Bush Races. It was ten dollars to go in.\nMegaera said we were researchers, wanting to\ninterview people about living in the bush.\nFor The Good Weekend? they said. We had no idea\nwhat she was talking about, but nodded. From that moment we learned to bluff,\nhalf-say, go dumb, simulate. Our language was described\nas backpacker English. People always fill in your blanks\nand the twenty-first century is no exception.\nWe could smell horses and beer. Have you any idea where we are? Megaera said\nto the woman at the gate. Burning Mountain, she said,\nthen Guyra at the top of the Range.\nCold? we said.\nMinus thirteen it can be, she said. Try the Motel Isis. Up a sloping paddock was a scarecrow competition \u2013\na double row of them, maybe sixty, a road\u2019s width apart.\nYou could walk along judging them.\nOne whose gut was a pumpkin \u2013 one in a tu-tu \u2013\nthen a stall selling whips by a master-plaiter from Bendigo. Next a face-painting stall and the smell of camels\nnear the beer tent. The occasional crack\nof a whip that was being auctioned gave Alecto a laugh.\nThere were a few tricks she could\u2019ve shown them,\nbut she wasn\u2019t about to. Reminds me though, she said. We were in effect incognito and would be for months.\nGuides took us on tours of The Dog on the Tuckerbox,\nthe Jenolan Caves, Seaworld, Movieworld,\nthe Big Pineapple\nand the Great Barrier Reef. Down near Goulburn we went inside\na stressed-concrete ram, the Big Merino.\nWe climbed up a ladder and looked out his perspex eyes\nat the row of commission houses leading into town \u2013\nthe real world, so-called.",

  "text": "\u00a0 Que scais-je? I wake up to the sound of music played\non pipes or strings ? my father\u2019s whim, not mine.\nHe believes my tender brain might bruise\nif I wake too suddenly. Saturnine\ncows orbit his estate and confuse\nthemselves with a grove\u2019s piebald shade. It\u2019s early. Bullish nostrils quivering steam.\nDew-shuddering trees and a clatter of stallions.\nStuttering chickens peck and servants scrub\nfloors, an armada of grey galleons\nscouring shallows. One of them, a snub-\nnosed woman, I recall \u2013 that is, I seem to recall, for I have no memory to speak\nof, only curiosity \u2013 comes from the same\nvillage on my father\u2019s estate where I\nwas put out to nurse. I greet her by name.\nMornings like these, before the sun gets high,\nI like to ride: I prefer the oblique paths which wander and meander to the one\nwhich goes straight to the truth. Mist rises\nfrom the fields, all patchwork, like our deeds,\nand we ride. How one exercises\none\u2019s judgement choosing a suitable steed\nis a question worthy of a theologian: do we judge a horse racing, walking or at rest\nin the stable? And how do we judge a king:\nupon the throne of state, or on that private\nthrone, his private estate? I read the steaming\ndollops falling from the jouncing nates\nof my companion\u2019s horse as I would a text of some thousands of words, theorising\non the consistency of excrement\nand what it tells us of the teeth, the heart,\nthe firmness of the gut and the contentment\nand the clearness of a conscience. The fart\nis a different matter: a vapid, rank uprising disproving the obedience of the anus\nas it is discussed in Vives\u2019 commentary\non Augustine\u2019s man who synchronised\nhis farts to the steady alimentary\nmetre of verses his friends devised.\nUsually it is most unruly and mutinous \u2013 much like our current form of government.\nI am fortunate to be born in depraved times:\nfor very little effort I am thought\nvirtuous; abstaining from the crimes\nwhich are the weapons of that war fought\nhere, in the hub of civil discontent, allows me idle hours, time which breeds\nchimeras and grotesque things. Variety\nalone satisfies me. We pass a field\nof sheaves of wheat whispering like a society\nof academicians. Weighed down by their yield\nthey learn humility and lower their heads, but in the next field ears of wheat rise high\nand lofty, heads erect and proud as they\nare empty. What do I know? That I can\u2019t bear\nbeing shut up in a room, that children play\nwith knucklebones, men with words, and where,\nbefore they enter our lives, diseases lie is a mystery? Silent veins of smoke\nthread the air. Over the fields a clump\nof houses appears, bristling with sound: notes\nfrom a strident rooster, the mill\u2019s slow thump.\nThis is the village where children suckle on goats\nand the poor hide their diseases with a cloak of gentle words which relieve the pain and soften\ntheir harshness. What would we do without names?\nWorldly troubles are mostly grammatical\nand we have taught our ladies\u2019 cheeks to flame\nat the mere mention of what they are not at all\nafraid to do. Sometimes in daylight. And often. I could ride for hours: pacing does not tire\nme as much as a set journey which forces\nme straight ahead instead of the roads which chance\nthrows up. I think my ideas are like horses.\nSometimes they follow each other at a distance;\nat others they glance sidelong at each other. The path declines and we descend and muddy\nhooves spatter our caparisons.\nTo what could I liken this river? A moulting\nsnake? What matter our comparisons\nwhen this river, like a civil war, is revolting\nagainst itself, eroding its banks? I study the surface, shedding scales of light; beneath,\non the river-bed the wind?s shadow furrows\nits skin like a plough. I study everything:\nwhat I must flee and that which I must follow,\nalthough since my earliest days nothing\nhas occupied my mind more than death, but I\u2019ve never gnawed my nails over Aristotle.\nOnce, as I stood on the headland of my brother,\nthe Sieur d\u2019Asac\u2019s lands in M?doc, I saw the waves\nbreak over what was once his land. At another\ntime he had been rich: now, nothing save\nfens and drains remain from his battle with the sea. We continue over dunes\nunder puffed up clouds and pass a flotilla\nof ducks quacking in tiny epicycles\non the current. I cannot stay still. A\nmind does nothing but whirl around like little\nsilkworms which then get tangled in cocoons. One and the same pace of my horse seems to me\nnow rough, now easy; the same road at one\ntime shorter, another time longer; one and the same\nview now more, now less pleasing; the sun\nnow shines too hot, now too feeble a flame\nto warm my tired bones. Now I am ready to do anything, now to do nothing. I do\nnothing but come and go and I\u2019m unable\neven to rid myself of vice, I just exchange\none for another. Only a fool is immovable\nand certain. The sun has become a blazing orange\nrising towards the meridian of depthless blue. It\u2019s getting hot. I could stay all day\nin the saddle, riding around and about without\nflagging. Recently I\u2019ve heard of a tribe\nof cannibals in the new world. I do not doubt\nthere is more barbarity in eating a man alive\nthan dead; but who are we to talk, who flay our enemies alive like dumb creatures\nwhen they are men, like us? These cannibals\nknow valour; they would rather be killed and eaten\nthan ask not to be. To a man they are unable\nto yield to fear: they are killed, not beaten.\nBut then again, they do not wear breeches. A horn sounds. My neighbour hunts again.\nGentlemen are mounting their horses, eager\nto course across the grounds and chase some hare,\npetrified, and watch lean hounds crush meagre\nbones and fur in their grim jaws. I share\nthe thrill of a hunt, but cannot stand the pain. I steer my horse homewards \u2013 there is a shelf\nin my circular library filled with books which say\nthe earth and planets revolve around the sun.\nPerhaps that is the case. For every day\nour fortunes change and turn around our sovereign\nking. But I revolve within myself.",

But there was the gentle sky And it was going nowhere and blaming no-one fast \u2013 a vast intelligence\ncanvassing nothing special,\ndrawn taut and candid and empty\nOver the whole carnal world. A charged void, the flip side of knowledge, The other side of pleasure, and there could have been nothing wrong\nin the world \u2013 nothing at all \u2013\nbut then the wind stirred, and I fell\nfrom the sky\u2019s sly boat back into the hammock and remembered All of them. But Paradise, in my experience,\nis only herself for minutes at a time.\nOutside of that, she\u2019s the possum shitting in the ceiling above you;\nshe\u2019s your man and his children from his first time round; she\u2019s the house\nand the copperhead under it, And the mortgage over it, and she\u2019s the parrots flaring\nat dusk. Most of it is shit,\nmy doctor said to me once, a man whose love and medicine had failed\nto save his wife, a man caring for three teenagers now.\nHating it and loving Them. Most of love is shit. But this is the best\nI will ever have been, I was thinking,\nhanging there from the sky; and that second, I stopped being it\nand start missing it, and the wind fell and rose again.\nAnd later my son found me And fell into the hammock with me,\nthe very cradle of his world.\nI just want you, the boy said, as though I really were something.\nI rocked with him a while,\nand then we stepped down and walked back Into the lengthening afternoon\nof the rest of our days. And the morning after,\nI woke and saw that the word had got out early and written itself all over\nthe place, especially in the east but also\non the leaves of the grasses, in colours The holy spirit would have been proud of\nback in the old days,\nbefore she unstopped the world\u2019s bottle and seeped\nlike some profound and original sin\nwell into next week.",

It dives where we imagine it darker still though it may be\nsilvered with the rhythm of small fish. Needing air,\nneeding to be underwater, if it maintains a straight line, it should emerge over there, or there. We reach into ourselves\nbut can\u2019t say anything except quite or just,\nshaping fish that squeeze through our palms and slip away. ~ Speech has been selected, the philosopher muses\nto out-think thought. He could say an oracle\nis just as true when false. This also a new reality on the ground as is a Man Ray photograph\nof a cork, a feather and a spiral object entitled\n\u2018Origin of the Species\u2019, or the rayographs he invented in a darkroom accident.

Sea eagles swing above and coming in low and chevron-shaped\nis a three-gull flight.

Sea and sky elide so cliffs\nexist as premonition. Cars prowl like cats at night,\nthe world not quite awake, not quite sure what will emerge. The new liberators\nare caught on film dissimulating sex,\nlinking hooded men to faux-electric wires.

Anything that climbs is a song; vines are a song; my father,\n70 years old, at the top of the ackee tree is a song; all planes are songs. Song\nwas a low-cost airline operated by Delta.

Tomorrow you might walk on as an extra in the film of Brick Lane- relocated to Turnpike \u2013 & the money you make will go into the fund for the plans we make. Reading John James in bed I am starting to believe that I am here again. You say you are hot but wrap your legs into mine, well there\u2019s nothing the breeze from Shoeburyness \u2013 through the curtains and over the dresser \u2013 can do about that. I can\u2019t wait for our future together you say, but when does it start ? The night it happened, two weeks ago, I was no more aware of what I was going to say than would you like more wine ? Ness, our time was then. The kestrel had cut its own shape against the sky like a tattoo on the retina \u2013 hovered with no wind \u2013 & as the bats, like burned swifts, tried to skirt the subject it was too late : the stars had already put us on the map. Very quietly & very secretly should we get married ? Between us a glance of vitreous success that wanted to last, as if this piece of Dagenham grass would be our legacy. We waited, holding hands, for the first show of fox. Dogs barked & plotted out the silent tracks she made. Imagined fox gave way to fox \u2013 swift on the outhouse, feral, musically-ribbed \u2013 all was perfect this as she passed. Mongrel Max clambered his trampoline & scared her off. Midnight we found the doors but the walls were too thick \u2013 accustomed as we were to the poise of night our home seemed docile, an oafish fist of brick. We went to bed & the rest is this : a cost of one hundred pounds, a catalogue dress at two pounds sixty for 52 weeks. Last night I dreamt us a thumbnail baby with no rollover link but as we looked close we were so pleased with the breaths that it took. Ness, I think we are starting now. Don\u2019t tell anyone until the Summer\u2019s gone.",

  "text": "I\nMidnight is a parliament of frogs. The ground vibrates with their shrill\ncontentions, the various factions of their self-belief, and my breath smokes\nthe black air, inventing galaxies\nthat spread and atrophy\nbefore I can breathe them back again. The night smells like any one\nof a dozen childhood camps, in which the present has pitched her tent. II\nThe trick is to fall asleep beside your sons at eight and sleep\nthem to sleep till ten and wake and stalk the sleeping house till twelve.\nThese are the hours the rest of your life\nspins around and nothing is impossible\nand nothing has to happen. And in the morning the news\nthat I have reached the shed reaches me as I reach the shed, and it all starts over. III\nBy noon, the sun is in recession and the future is in cloud and the day is cold in its boots.\nThe wind comes off the road now bringing me news of every passing car.\nSo the fallen world goes.\nOne\u2019s work in it, a purgation.\nA steep and necessary climb under friendly fire. The price one pays\nfor loving too well the imperfect world is the imperfection of the world. IV\nTrees, those ossified spirits, quicken in a rising wind. They circle me,\npleading their silent cases when I leave the shed to pee.\nWinter loosens the world\u2019s grip on itself;\nit stands our slender inner lives\nout in the weather. The black cat, who\u2019s wandered into our care like a saint\ninto retirement, climbs two arthritic steps ahead of me and falls into the blue chair. V\nWhite-cheeked rosellas bright as drag queens in the morning rain;\nthe easterly air and the daffodils the children planted, pushing up out of winter,\nand the wood-ducks on the river:\nthis is how it always went. In the beginning\nwas the world. And in the end. The words came in the middle. The world\ngave them to us with no particular end in mind. And what shall one give in return? VI\nI sit here writing poems like cheques, wondering\nif they\u2019ll bounce, when the phone rings, and I drop my best pen,\nnib down, and it doesn\u2019t.\nAs oracles go, that\u2019s blunt. We\u2019re speculators,\nmy friend the painter tells me; we back what\u2019s in our heads;\nwe float our souls in a deregulated market, helpless as lovers, hopeless as drunks. VII\nI sit in the ebb of winter writing fifty-dollar poems at a thousand-dollar desk:\nthe story of one\u2019s life. My desk is made of railway sleepers\nwhich I sit here, morning on morning,\ntrying to wake. This is no way to prosper,\nbut that\u2019s not what it\u2019s for. I\u2019m doing what the ironbarks did\nbefore they felled them; I\u2019m doing what the fettlers did after that. VIII\nYou do what you must. The work at hand. You stand; you fall; you give\nbeneath the profane rhythm that travels you daily, in which you are told,\nbut only obscurely why. As I walk\nto my shed and hear the cows across the river,\nI think I\u2019d rather be going down to work as hard to do and as easy\nto define as men once did down here. But I stop wanting that at the door. IX\nTim from downriver came to the river when the bottom fell out of the valley.\nI didn\u2019t want to keep doing, he told me, for twenty-seven cents a gallon\nwhat had been hard enough for thirty years at fifty. \nAnd now his neighbour\u2019s spoiling the river\nto carry a road to his new subdivision in what Tim had mistaken\nfor his view. Landscape\u2014another deregulated market. X\nWhen I say to him, conversing, as neighbours do at dusk by a river,\nSame thing happened to poetry long ago, he laughs at whatever he thinks I mean\nand shows me the ruins\nof the old bridge where the cattle used to traffic\nbetween the now doomed paddocks of the middle distance and my shed.\nThe future\u2019s going the same way the past went. Only sooner. XI\nI was born empty, and each morning I wake empty again.\nWho you are is where you\u2019ve slept and whom you\u2019ve slept there with.\nThis morning, then, I am three children\nand the Osage Orange at the door;\nI am the ice on the windshield and the summit of world leaders come to nothing\nup the road. In flood by nine, I walk to the shed to empty myself making phrases. XII\nIt\u2019s one kind of sin to stay indoors today, spring coiled in the morning\u2019s bed,\nparrots limning the ends of winter. It\u2019s another kind to leave one\u2019s work undone.\nNo way out, no way back,\nI throw wide the barn door and compromise.\nThe outside walks on in; the inside out. My deaf and dilapidated muse sleeps on\nin the reading chair, like one of the saved. White blossoms open on my fingertips.",

IV\nTwo nights later the moon rises nicotine-stained and peaceable\ninto the fingers of the silver trees,\nand the floodplain is a smokefilled basement.\nOut of the blue sprawling mist the plover\u2019s mad call:\nwhy will a river not stay in the ground?\nOut on the deck, I draw down deep on the evening and turn and walk V\nIts balm inside and search again briefly for the frequency of family life\nand I find it in the bath, my girl\nand our three children, sleek as seals,\nand in that moment a truck passes on the road\nand snaps the powerline from the eaves. The house shudders and we fall\nback in time to candles and stories by heart and reading the news from memory. VI\nThe earth, it seems, has caught a fever, and where will she lie\nto rest? When the men come\nand plug us back in, I believe I hear her\ngroan. How will she begin\nto forgive us, or is that what she\u2019s been doing all along?\nIn the night the mist rolls away, and at dawn there\u2019s a frost over everything. VII\nYou\u2019d call it a blessing if you hadn\u2019t been woken four times\nby minor deities, pyjamaed like children\nand frantic in the dark with oracles.\nWhy do our children not know how to sleep?\nDo they fear we\u2019ve left our waking late? At first light they dawn\nand have you rise and lead them out into the story VIII\nThe river has told the grass again, a parable the day has forgotten by nine.\nAnd by ten, at your desk, you\u2019ve forgotten it, too.\nA man so easily distracted\nby himself. But what are you here for\nand what do they love, if not the way you leave each day to change the world\u2019s\nmind and return with the night, your feet cold, your face lined with secrets?",

These three might seem\nthe project of a class of kids; except for the cunning which had placed the group\nof crosses, if we call them crosses,\nin silhouette, against the setting sun,\nher lux in embro; or the paler moon.

Opinions abound but who is wrong and who is right?\nPeople need a prophet, a diffuser of the light,\nSomeone they can turn to as the crises rage and swirl,\nSomeone with the remedy, the wisdom, the pearl\u2026 Well, they should have asked my husband, he\u2019d have really gone to town.\nWith his thoughts on immigration, teenage mothers, Gordon Brown,\nThe future of the monarchy, house prices in the South,\nThe wait for hip replacements, BSE and foot-and-mouth. Oh, they should have asked my husband, he can sort out any mess,\nHe can rejuvenate the railways, he can cure the NHS\nSo any little niggle, anything you want to know\nJust run it past my husband, wind him up and let him go. Congestion on the motorways, free holidays for thugs,\nThe damage to the ozone layer, refugees, drugs,\nThese may defeat the brain of any politician bloke,\nBut present it to my husband: he will solve it at a stroke. He\u2019ll clarify the situation, he will make it crystal clear,\nYou\u2019ll feel the glazing of your eyeballs and the bending of your ear.\nCorruption at the top, he\u2019s an authority on that,\nAnd the Mafia, Gaddafia and Yasser Arafat. Upon these areas he brings his intellect to shine\nIn a great compelling voice that\u2019s twice as loud as yours or mine,\nI often wonder what it must be like to be so strong,\nInfallible, articulate, self-confident and wrong. When it comes to tolerance he hasn\u2019t got a lot,\nJoy-riders should be guillotined and muggers should be shot,\nThe sound of his own voice becomes like music to his ears,\nAnd he hasn\u2019t got an inkling that he\u2019s boring us to tears. My friends don\u2019t call so often, they have busy lives I know,\nBut it\u2019s not every day you want to hear a windbag suck and blow.\nEncyclopaedias! On them we never have to call,\nWhy clutter up the bookshelf when my husband\u2026 knows it all.",

I can imagine chickens in their patio,\nAt Christmastime a wattled turkey-cock, a dog Weathered like a wash-board, yellow-eyed,\nThat no one stroked, but ate the scraps of bread And yapped to earn his keep. I understand\nThe family prospered though the father drank And now the second brother drinks, often\nTo excess. I understand as well that love Came early, bladed, and then went away\nAnd came again in other forms, some foreign, And took him by the heart away from home.\nHis father was a baker in Oaxaca And here I smell the loaves that rose in ovens\nThroughout a childhood not yet quite complete And smell the fragrance of his jet-black hair,\nTaste his sweet dialect that is mine too, Until I understand I am to be a baker,\nUp before dawn with trays and trays of dough To feed him this day, next day and for ever \u2014\nOr for a time \u2014 the honey-coloured loaves.",

Then one by one the ladybirds appeared\nobeying some far purpose or design.\nWe marvelled at their numbers in the garden,\ngrouped together, shuffling in a line. Each day a few strays turned up at the table,\nthe children laughed to see them near the jam\nexploring round the edges of a spoon.\nOne tried to drink the moisture on my arm. How random and how frail seemed their lives,\nand yet how they persisted, refugees,\nsaving energy by keeping still\nand hiding in the grass and in the trees. And then one day they vanished overnight.\nClouds gathered, storm exploded, weather cleared.\nAnd all the wishes that we might have had\nin such abundance simply disappeared.",

The waiter waved out the flame.\nCan I get you a drink, sir?\nSun\u2019s over the yard arm. The waiter stood in the cylinder\nof his white shift, understanding\nor not. The train bucked,\ngathering speed. He levelled himself\nnaturally as a glass of water. Jenkins blew smoke towards him. Also there is an Englishman, English boy,\nsir, on the train with \u2026 other people.\nReally? Who?\nI don\u2019t know name, sir.\nWell, tell him to come and see me,\nand the answer is yes, bring me a drink. * The carriage dark with bodies.\nBright smells of opened fruit.\nHe asked questions and had\none old man talking because\nhe loved the plush impacts\nof their consonants, the glimmer\nof teeth, and had missed the sound\nof thoughts fetched and weighed\nand slowly spoken, ideas\nthat had formed slowly in the sun,\na million miles from the bark\nand whine and snivel\nand brag of school.\nIt soothed him. The noble cheekbones soothed him. The old man looked like Joseph\nfrom his own farm\nwho always had something\nsmall and alive to show. He spoke of his son in the city,\nthe difficult life, and ambition. Then a cough, a touch on his shoulder. Excuse me, sir. Mr Jenkins invites you\nto go to him, please. * Tables. Empty Seats. Napery.\nThe proper way to sit. This Jenkins, half-remembered, had a tweed moustache:\nthreads of ginger brown and white I assume you don\u2019t smoke yet and hair so thin and waxed,\nfastidiously flat,\nit looked like a lick of paint. You haven\u2019t been back long.\nJenkins observed the boy\u2019s white skin\nas though the observation were cunning. I flew in this morning.\nAnd school?\nIs finished. I go up to university in autumn.\nJenkins, who had not been, did not ask which one.\nFinal summer. You might have stayed in England,\nyou know. It might have been better.\nTom said nothing, then: I wanted to come back. Jenkins held his cigarette down\ninto the ashtray until it was out,\nthe last smoke crawling up his hand, into his sleeve. I presume your father has written to you\nabout the situation. Tom, trying to pull his eyes politely\nback from the view to Jenkins:\nHe mentioned it. It\u2019s bad enough, Jenkins leaned forward\nsending quiet words out one by one\nlike bees from the gap of their hive,\nthat you should not be in there\ntalking with them. Tom blinked, fingertips on table edge.\nBut I\u2019ve always \u2026 Oh, we\u2019ve all always but things are different.\nThe oathing has been going on\nround your father?s estate. Oathing? The ceremonies, the pledges:\njoin or your throat cut.\nOr worse. Not far from here\ntwo wouldn\u2019t.\nCut to bits, buried, dug up,\nand then others forced to eat bits,\nkeep them in line. Of course\none broke down and spilled it. Jenkins regarded Tom, the boy\u2019s\nfingertips still on the table edge,\nmouth slightly open, blushing\nwith fear, the fine and healthy fear\nthat might save him. * Jenkins was met by Fuller\nwho led him to the car under trees already black,\nthe first stars prickling in their branches,\nthe two men walking, not talking. Then, in the car, Fuller:\nWe\u2019ve picked up two more.\nOh, yes?\nYes. Chaps got a bit worked up,\nactually, sort of let them\nhave it somewhat. * Jenkins decided as soon as he saw\nwhat a hash they\u2019d made\nof their faces, heard\ntheir soft noises, lying there. Mr Prior the youngest there, smoking from\na flutter of fingertips, legs crossed, take these gentlemen\noutside and end their suffering, would you. Prior looked up. No one else looked.\nWhen he had them up on their feet\nand out of there, briefly,\nat each other, they looked. He made them walk in front.\nSeeing their hands tied\nin the smalls of their backs\nhis brain was smitten with a thought,\nover complicated, strictly meaningless,\nlike a fever thought:\nthe captive\u2019s captive hands\nand he the captor, three boxes: outermost he,\ninnermost, their hands, their bodies\u2019\nown prisoners.\nIt made no sense. Stepping with his dusty brogues\ninto the weak backs of their knees\nhe made them kneel\nand to do it quicker than he could think\nshot them one two\neach opened head falling away\nfrom his hand. When Jenkins came out he looked up\nand knew that there was more two do:\nhe\u2019d have to clean\nwith bucket and sponge\neach wet red gust\nfrom the station wall.",

Hard to conceive that they should be\nPrecisely who they are and here,\nLost in the idle luxury of play.\nAnd hard to credit that the self-same sea\nThat joins them in their idleness today,\nCareless of latitude and hemisphere,\nBlind with ubiquity, Churns elsewhere with a white uproar,\nOr wipes the Slave Coast clean of trees,\nOr sucks among the scum and floating drums\nOf some forgotten outpost founded for\nThe advent of an age that never comes,\nOr bobs the remnants of atrocities\nLimply against the shore. What luck they have. And what good sense\nTo leave the water with their toys\nWhen called, before their fortunes are deranged.\nAnd still the day hangs in its late suspense\nFor hours without them, virtually unchanged,\nUntil the bay\u2019s impregnable turquoise\nRelaxes its defence And sunset\u2019s dye begins to spread\nIn flood across it to the sand\nThey stood on, as though, hoping to disown\nThe blood of all the innocents he\u2019d shed,\nMacbeth incarnate or his grisly clone\nHad stooped on some far shore to rinse his hand,\nMaking the green one red.",

  "text": "\u00a0 One night in Paris I saw glowing in a small shopwindow a page of Ren? Char\u2019s handwriting: Recours au ruisseau. The delicate ink of finality. At the foot of the poem I saw where Char had dated it \u2013 three years and two days before my birth. At that hour the backstreet, somewhere between the Mus?e d\u2019Orsay and Op?ra, was completely deserted. Lit by a single lightbulb, the window seemed to have waited over half a century to find me. Last night I dreamt again of my own death. Guided by the head priest of some strange church I was ascending the inner staircase of an immense tower, just ahead of me my family and the serene and tender face of the Buddhist poet, my friend Judy. We marvelled at the wall we were climbing against \u2013 a magnificent rust-red patterned in waterpipes, putti and other embellishments of the underworld. With my crippled leg and damaged body I had fallen behind the others when a stair broke, the cracked stone slab crashing into the darkness below. I woke on a stretcher inside the church. The priest had bandaged me and removed my calliper and I lay there praying that I would stand and walk again. In the poem Char promises that he will \u201cbegin again higher up\u201d, that when all is destroyed the river will speak. The priest\u2019s voice flowed on, a darkened stream in which I could recognise no reflection but which held, I sensed this strongly, no malevolence. Weighed down by his robes of office he was simply doing what he could, human and divine, to summon a miracle. Impatient to rejoin my family I tried to put the calliper back on but my fingers no longer knew how to grasp laces or buckle straps. I rested at the top of a low hill where the dry yellow grass folded around me. In the distance, unreachable now, was a small stream that divided me from the others. The magic rites of the church were beginning to take effect as I woke again in the air a little way above myself. The panic of not being there for my children came and went in waves like a long cargo ship buried in the shadow of bridges, like everything else abandoned to its own fate. I remembered the flooded world of Char\u2019s landscapes, barges gliding through villages and under fortified walls, and that beautiful word l\u2019amont, \u201cupstream\u201d. I remembered the confident builder he was, defiant of all downfalls. I was already dead and I was still only just underway.",

Your hands,\nOn which the earth had dried in layers, itched, itched,\nThough worse still was that ache along the tips\nOf every picking finger, each broken nail\nThat scraped the ground for sprawled potatoes\nThe turning digger churned out of the drills.\nMuttering strong Irish men and women worked\nQuicker than local boys. You had to watch them.\nThey had the trick of sideways-bolted spuds\nFast to your ear, and the upset wire basket\nThat broke your heart but made the Irish laugh.\nYou moaned, complained, and learned the rules of work.\nYour boots, enlarging as the day wore on,\nWere weighted by the magnets of the earth,\nAnd rain in the face was also to have\nSomething in common with bedraggled Irish.\nYou held your hands into the rain, then watched\nBrown water drip along your chilling fingers\nUntil you saw the colour of your skin\nThrough rips disfiguring your gloves of mud.\nIt was the same for everyone. All day\nThat bead of sweat tickled your smeared nose\nAnd a glance upwards would show you trees and clouds\nIn turbulent collusions of the sky\nWith ground and ground with sky, and you portrayed\nAmong the wretched of the native earth.\nTowards the end you felt you understood\nThe happy rancour of the Irish howkers.\nWhen dusk came down, you stood beside the byre\nFor the farmer\u2019s wife to pay the labour off.\nAnd this is what I remember by the dark\nWhitewash of the byre wall among shuffling boots.\nShe knew me, but she couldn\u2019t tell my face\nFrom an Irish boy\u2019s, and she apologised\nAnd roughed my hair as into my cupped hands\nShe poured a dozen pennies of the realm\nAnd placed two florins there, then cupped her hands\nAround my hands, like praying together.\nIt is not good to feel you have no future.\nMy clotted hands turned coins to muddy copper.\nI tumbled all my coins upon our table.\nMy mother ran a basin of hot water.\nWe bathed my wages and we scrubbed them clean.\nOnce all that sediment was washed away,\nThat residue of field caked on my money,\nI filled the basin to its brim with cold;\nAnd when the water settled I could see\nTwo English kings among their drowned Britannias.",

When really it\u2019s all chance\nAnd the special one might have been anyone. The paths that I imagined to have come\nTogether and for good have simply crossed\nAnd carried on. And that delirium\nWe found is cold and sober now and lost. The crescent moon, to quote myself, lies back,\nA radiotelescope propped to receive\nThe signals of the circling zodiac.\nI send my thoughts up, wishing to believe That they might strike the moon and be transferred\nTo where you are and find or join your own.\nDon\u2019t smile.

II If I am meek and dull\nAnd a poor sacrifice\nOf perverse will to cull\nThe act from the attempt,\nJust look into damned eyes\nAnd give the returning glare;\nFor the damned like it, the more\nDamnation is exempt\nFrom what would save its heir\nWith a thing worth living for. III The poisoned rat in the wall\nCuts through the wall like a knife,\nThen blind, drying, and small\nAnd driven to cold water,\nDies of the water of life:\nBoth damned in eternal ice,\nThe traitor become the boor\nWho has led his friend to slaughter,\nNow bites his head \u2013 not nice,\nThe food that he lives for. IV I supposed two scenes of hell,\nTwo human bestiaries\nMight uncommonly well\nConvey the doom I thought;\nBut lest the horror freeze\nThe gentler estimation\nI go to the sylvan door\nWhere nature has been bought\nIn rational proration\nAs a thing worth living for. V Should the buyer have been beware?\nIt is an uneven trade\nFor man has wet his hair\nUnder the winter weather\nWith only fog for shade:\nHis mouth a bracketed hole\nPicked by the crows that bore\nNature to their hanged brother,\nWho rattles against the bole\nThe thing that he lived for. VI I asked the master Yeats\nWhose great style could not tell\nWhy it is man hates\nHis own salvation,\nPrefers the way to hell,\nAnd finds his last safety\nIn the self-made curse that bore\nHim towards damnation:\nThe drowned undrowned by the sea,\nThe sea worth living for.",

I watched him with pleasure.\nI bought memory. I could have lost it.\nHow crazy it sounds. His face twisted with cunning.\nThe wind blowing through his hair. His jaw working.",

The voice of light\nHad come forth from the body of fire, and each thing\nRose from its depths and shone as it never had.\nAnd that was the second great poem,\nWhich no one recalls anymore. The third and greatest\nCame into the world as the world, out of the unsayable,\nInvisible source of all longing to be; it came\nAs things come that will perish, to be seen or heard\nAwhile, like the coating of frost or the movement\nOf wind, and then no more; it came in the middle of sleep\nLike a door to the infinite, and, circled by flame,\nCame again at the moment of waking, and, sometimes,\nRemote and small, it came as a vision with trees\nBy a weaving stream, brushing the bank\nWith their violet shade, with somebody\u2019s limbs\nScattered among the matted, mildewed leaves nearby,\nWith his severed head rolling under the waves,\nBreaking the shifting columns of light into a swirl\nOf slivers and flecks; it came in a language\nUntouched by pity, in lines, lavish and dark,\nWhere death is reborn and sent into the world as a gift,\nSo the future, with no voice of its own, nor hope\nOf ever becoming more than it will be, might mourn.",

  "text": "\u00a0 I see the mosquito kneeling on the soft underside of my arm, kneeling\nLike a fruitpicker, kneeling like an old woman\nWith the proboscis of her prayer buried in the idea of God,\nAnd I know we shall not speak with the aliens\nAnd that peace will not happen in my life, not unless\nIt is in the burnt oil spreading across the surfaces of ponds, in the dark\nEgg rafts clotting and the wiggletails expiring like batteries.\nBring a little alcohol and a little balm\nFor these poppies planted by the Queen of Neptune.\nIn her photographs she is bearded and spurred, embellished five hundred times,\nHer modular legs crouching, her insufferable head unlocking\nTo lower the razor-edge of its tubes, and she is there in the afternoon\nWhen the wind gives up the spirit of cleanliness\nAnd there rises from the sound the brackish oyster and squid smell of creation.\nI lie down in the sleeping bag sodden with rain.\nNights with her, I am loved for myself, for the succulent\nFlange of my upper lip, the twin bellies of my eyelids.\nShe adores the easy, the soft. She picks the tenderest blossoms of insomnia.\nMornings while the jackhammer rips the pavement outside my window,\nWhile the sanitation workers bang the cans against the big truck and shout to each other over the motor,\nI watch her strut like an udder with my blood,\nImagining the luminous pick descending into Trotsky\u2019s skull and the eleven days\nI waited for the cold chill, nightmare, and nightsweat of malaria;\nImagining the mating call in the vibrations of her wings,\nAnd imagining, in the simple knot of her ganglia,\nHow she thrills to my life, how she sings for the harvest.",

Cries galore\ncome from the water-closet door,\nfrom the dropping-plastered henhouse floor, where in the blue blur\ntheir rusting wives admire,\nthe roosters brace their cruel feet and glare with stupid eyes\nwhile from their beaks there rise\nthe uncontrolled, traditional cries. Deep from protruding chests\nin green-gold medals dressed,\nplanned to command and terrorize the rest, the many wives\nwho lead hens\u2019 lives\nof being courted and despised; deep from raw throats\na senseless order floats\nall over town. A rooster gloats over our beds\nfrom rusty irons sheds\nand fences made from old bedsteads, over our churches\nwhere the tin rooster perches,\nover our little wooden northern houses, making sallies\nfrom all the muddy alleys,\nmarking out maps like Rand McNally\u2019s: glass-headed pins,\noil-golds and copper greens,\nanthracite blues, alizarins, each one an active\ndisplacement in perspective;\neach screaming, \u201cThis is where I live!\u201d Each screaming\n\u201cGet up! Stop dreaming!\u201d\nRoosters, what are you projecting? You, whom the Greeks elected\nto shoot at on a post, who struggled\nwhen sacrificed, you whom they labeled \u201cVery combative\u2026\u201d\nwhat right have you to give\ncommands and tell us how to live, cry \u201cHere!\u201d and \u201cHere!\u201d\nand wake us here where are\nunwanted love, conceit and war? The crown of red\nset on your little head\nis charged with all your fighting blood Yes, that excrescence\nmakes a most virile presence,\nplus all that vulgar beauty of iridescence Now in mid-air\nby two they fight each other\n.Down comes a first flame-feather, and one is flying,\nwith raging heroism defying\neven the sensation of dying. And one has fallen\nbut still above the town\nhis torn-out, bloodied feathers drift down; and what he sung\nno matter. He is flung\non the gray ash-heap, lies in dung with his dead wives\nwith open, bloody eyes,\nwhile those metallic feathers oxidize. St. Peter\u2019s sin\nwas worse than that of Magdalen\nwhose sin was of the flesh alone; of spirit, Peter\u2019s,\nfalling, beneath the flares,\namong the \u201cservants and officers.\u201d Old holy sculpture\ncould set it all together\nin one small scene, past and future: Christ stands amazed,\nPeter, two fingers raised\nto surprised lips, both as if dazed. But in between\na little cock is seen\ncarved on a dim column in the travertine, explained by gallus canit;\nflet Petrus underneath it,\nThere is inescapable hope, the pivot; yes, and there Peter\u2019s tears\nrun down our chanticleer\u2019s\nsides and gem his spurs. Tear-encrusted thick\nas a medieval relic\nhe waits. Poor Peter, heart-sick, still cannot guess\nthose cock-a-doodles yet might bless,\nhis dreadful rooster come to mean forgiveness, a new weathervane\non basilica and barn,\nand that outside the Lateran there would always be\na bronze cock on a porphyry\npillar so the people and the Pope might see that event the Prince\nof the Apostles long since\nhad been forgiven, and to convince all the assembly\nthat \u201cDeny deny deny\u201d\nis not all the roosters cry. In the morning\na low light is floating\nin the backyard, and gilding from underneath\nthe broccoli, leaf by leaf;\nhow could the night have come to grief? gilding the tiny\nfloating swallow\u2019s belly\nand lines of pink cloud in the sky, the day\u2019s preamble\nlike wandering lines in marble,\nThe cocks are now almost inaudible. The sun climbs in,\nfollowing \u201cto see the end,\u201d\nfaithful as enemy, or friend.",

  "text": "\u00a0 A new volcano has erupted,\nthe papers say, and last week I was reading\nwhere some ship saw an island being born:\nat first a breath of steam, ten miles away;\nand then a black fleck, basalt, probably \u2013\nrose in the mate\u2019s binoculars\nand caught on the horizon like a fly.\nThey named it. But my poor old island\u2019s still\nun-rediscovered, un-renamable.\nNone of the books has ever got it right. Well, I had fifty-two\nmiserable, small volcanoes I could climb\nwith a few slithery strides \u2013\nvolcanoes dead as ash heaps.\nI used to sit on the edge of the highest one\nand count the others standing up,\nnaked and leaden, with their heads blown off.\nI\u2019d think that if they were the size\nI thought volcanoes should be, then I had\nbecome a giant;\nand if I had become a giant,\nI couldn\u2019t bear to think what size\nthe goats and turtles were,\nor the gulls, or the overlapping rollers\n\u2013 a glittering hexagon of rollers\nclosing and closing in, but never quite,\nglittering and glittering, though the sky\nwas mostly overcast. My island seemed to be\na sort of cloud-dump. All the hemisphere\u2019s\nleft-over clouds arrived and hung\nabove the craters \u2013 their parched throats\nwere hot to touch.\nWas that why it rained so much?\nAnd why sometimes the whole place hissed?\nThe turtles lumbered by, high-domed,\nhissing like teakettles.\n(And I\u2019d have given years, or taken a few,\nfor any sort of kettle, of course.)\nThe folds of lava, running out to sea,\nwould hiss. I\u2019d turn. And then they\u2019d prove\nto be more turtles.\nThe beaches were all lava, variegated,\nblack, red, and white, and gray;\nthe marbled colors made a fine display.\nAnd I had waterspouts. Oh,\nhalf a dozen at a time, far out,\nthey\u2019d come and go, advancing and retreating,\ntheir heads in cloud, their feet in moving patches\nof scuffed-up white.\nGlass chimneys, flexible, attenuated,\nsacerdotal beings of glass\u2026I watched\nthe water spiral up in them like smoke.\nBeautiful, yes, but not much company. I often gave way to self-pity.\n\u201cDo I deserve this? I suppose I must.\nI wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise. Was there\na moment when I actually chose this?\nI don\u2019t remember, but there could have been.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s wrong about self-pity, anyway?\nWith my legs dangling down familiarly\nover a crater\u2019s edge, I told myself\n\u201cPity should begin at home.\u201d So the more\npity I felt, the more I felt at home. The sun set in the sea; the same odd sun\nrose from the sea,\nand there was one of it and one of me.\nThe island had one kind of everything:\none tree snail, a bright violet-blue\nwith a thin shell, crept over everything,\nover the one variety of tree,\na sooty, scrub affair.\nSnail shells lay under these in drifts\nand, at a distance,\nyou\u2019d swear that they were beds of irises.\nThere was one kind of berry, a dark red.\nI tried it, one by one, and hours apart.\nSub-acid, and not bad, no ill effects;\nand so I made home-brew. I\u2019d drink\nthe awful, fizzy, stinging stuff\nthat went straight to my head\nand play my home-made flute\n(I think it had the weirdest scale on earth)\nand, dizzy, whoop and dance among the goats.\nHome-made, home-made! But aren\u2019t we all?\nI felt a deep affection for\nthe smallest of my island industries.\nNo, not exactly, since the smallest was\na miserable philosophy. Because I didn\u2019t know enough.\nWhy didn\u2019t I know enough of something?\nGreek drama or astronomy? The books\nI\u2019d read were full of blanks;\nthe poems \u2013 well, I tried\nreciting to my iris-beds,\n\u201cThey flash upon that inward eye,\nwhich is the bliss\u2026\u201d The bliss of what?\nOne of the first things that I did\nwhen I got back was look it up. The island smelled of goat and guano.\nThe goats were white, so were the gulls,\nand both too tame, or else they thought\nI was a goat, too, or a gull.\nBaa, baa, baa and shriek, shriek, shriek,\nbaa\u2026shriek\u2026baa\u2026I still can\u2019t shake\nthem from my ears; they\u2019re hurting now.\nThe questioning shrieks, the equivocal replies\nover a ground of hissing rain\nand hissing, ambulating turtles\ngot on my nerves.\nWhen all the gulls flew up at once, they sounded\nlike a big tree in a strong wind, its leaves.\nI\u2019d shut my eyes and think about a tree,\nan oak, say, with real shade, somewhere.\nI\u2019d heard of cattle getting island-sick.\nI thought the goats were.\nOne billy-goat would stand on the volcano\nI\u2019d christened Mont d\u2019Espoir or Mount Despair\n(I\u2019d time enough to play with names),\nand bleat and bleat, and sniff the air.\nI\u2019d grab his beard and look at him.\nHis pupils, horizontal, narrowed up\nand expressed nothing, or a little malice.\nI got so tired of the very colors!\nOne day I dyed a baby goat bright red\nwith my red berries, just to see\nsomething a little different.\nAnd then his mother wouldn\u2019t recognize him. Dreams were the worst. Of course I dreamed of food\nand love, but they were pleasant rather\nthan otherwise. But then I\u2019d dream of things\nlike slitting a baby\u2019s throat, mistaking it\nfor a baby goat. I\u2019d have\nnightmares of other islands\nstretching away from mine, infinities\nof islands, islands spawning islands,\nlike frogs\u2019 eggs turning into polliwogs\nof islands, knowing that I had to live\non each and every one, eventually,\nfor ages, registering their flora,\ntheir fauna, their geography. Just when I thought I couldn\u2019t stand it\nanother minute longer, Friday came.\n(Accounts of that have everything all wrong.)\nFriday was nice.\nFriday was nice, and we were friends.\nIf only he had been a woman!\nI wanted to propagate my kind,\nand so did he, I think, poor boy.\nHe\u2019d pet the baby goats sometimes,\nand race with them, or carry one around.\n\u2013 Pretty to watch; he had a pretty body. And then one day they came and took us off. Now I live here, another island,\nthat doesn\u2019t seem like one, but who decides?\nMy blood was full of them; my brain\nbred islands. But that archipelago\nhas petered out. I\u2019m old.\nI\u2019m bored, too, drinking my real tea,\nsurrounded by uninteresting lumber.\nThe knife there on the shelf \u2013\nit reeked of meaning, like a crucifix.\nIt lived. How many years did I\nbeg it, implore it, not to break?\nI knew each nick and scratch by heart,\nthe bluish blade, the broken tip,\nthe lines of wood-grain on the handle\u2026\nNow it won\u2019t look at me at all.\nThe living soul has dribbled away.\nMy eyes rest on it and pass on. The local museum\u2019s asked me to\nleave everything to them:\nthe flute, the knife, the shrivelled shoes,\nmy shedding goatskin trousers\n(moths have got in the fur),\nthe parasol that took me such a time\nremembering the way the ribs should go.\nIt still will work but, folded up,\nlooks like a plucked and skinny fowl.\nHow can anyone want such things?\n\u2013 And Friday, my dear Friday, died of measles\nseventeen years ago come March.",

The weather\nChanges in the black of night,\nAnd the dream-wind, bowling across The sopping open spaces\nOf roads, golf courses, parking lots,\nFlails a commotion\nIn the dripping treetops, Tries a half-rotten shingle\nOr a down-hung branch, and we\nAll dream it, the dark wind crossing\nThe wide spaces between us.",

After a while, we guessed Margie\u2019s\nilliteracy was why he cashed checks\nand she is perched near the threshold to ban pros,\nthe underage, the fugitive, and those\narrayed impertinently to their sex.\nThe bar was talk and cruising; in the back\nroom, we danced: Martha and the Vandellas,\nSmokey and the Miracles, while sellers\nand buyers changed crisp tens for smoke and smack.\nSome came in after work, some after supper,\nplumage replenished to meet who knew who.\nBehind the bar, Margie dished up beef stew.\nOn weeknights, you could always find an upper\nto speed you to your desk, and drink till four.\nLoosened by booze, we drifted, on the ripples\nof Motown, home in new couples, or triples,\nwere back at dusk, with IDs, at the door.\nBill was my roommate, Russell drank with me,\nalthough they were a dozen years my seniors.\nI walked off with the eighteen-year-old genius\n\u2013 an Older Woman, barely twenty-three.\nLink was new as Rimbaud, and better looking,\nNorth Beach bar paideon of doomed Jack Spicer,\nlike Russell, our two-meter artificer,\na Corvo whose ecclesia was cooking.\nBill and Russell were painters.

  "text": "\u00a0 Slow dulcimer, gavotte and bow, in autumn,\nBash\u014d and his friends go out to view the moon;\nIn summer, gasoline rainbow in the gutter, The secret courtesy that courses like ichor\nThrough the old form of the rude, full-scale joke,\nImpossible to tell in writing. \u201cBash\u014d\u201d He named himself, \u201cBanana Tree\u201d: banana\nAfter the plant some grateful students gave him,\nMaybe in appreciation of his guidance Threading a long night through the rules and channels\nOf their collaborative linking-poem\nScored in their teacher\u2019s heart: live, rigid, fluid Like passages etched in a microscopic circuit.\nElliot had in his memory so many jokes\nThey seemed to breed like microbes in a culture Inside his brain, one so much making another\nIt was impossible to tell them all:\nIn the court-culture of jokes, a top banana. Imagine a court of one: the queen a young mother,\nUnhappy, alone all day with her firstborn child\nAnd her new baby in a squalid apartment Of too few rooms, a different race from her neighbors.\nShe tells the child she\u2019s going to kill herself.\nShe broods, she rages. Hoping to distract her, The child cuts capers, he sings, he does imitations\nOf different people in the building, he jokes,\nHe feels if he keeps her alive until the father Gets home from work, they\u2019ll be okay till morning.\nIt\u2019s laughter versus the bedroom and the pills.\nWhat is he in his efforts but a courtier? Impossible to tell his whole delusion.\nIn the first months when I had moved back East\nFrom California and had to leave a message On Bob\u2019s machine, I used to make a habit\nOf telling the tape a joke; and part-way through,\nI would pretend that I forgot the punchline, Or make believe that I was interrupted \u2013\nAs though he\u2019d be so eager to hear the end\nHe\u2019d have to call me back. The joke was Elliot\u2019s, More often than not. The doctors made the blunder\nThat killed him some time later that same year.\nOne day when I got home I found a message On my machine from Bob. He had a story\nAbout two rabbis, one of them tall, one short,\nOne day while walking along the street together They see the corpse of a Chinese man before them,\nAnd Bob said, sorry, he forgot the rest.\nOf course he thought that his joke was a dummy, Impossible to tell \u2013 a dead-end challenge.\nBut here it is, as Elliot told it to me:\nThe dead man\u2019s widow came to the rabbis weeping, Begging them, if they could, to resurrect him.\nShocked, the tall rabbi said absolutely not.\nBut the short rabbi told her to bring the body Into the study house, and ordered the shutters\nClosed so the room was night-dark. Then he prayed\nOver the body, chanting a secret blessing Out of Kabala. \u201cArise and breathe,\u201d he shouted;\nBut nothing happened. The body lay still. So then\nThe little rabbi called for hundreds of candles And danced around the body, chanting and praying\nIn Hebrew, then Yiddish, then Aramaic. He prayed\nIn Turkish and Egyptian and Old Galician For nearly three hours, leaping about the coffin\nIn the candlelight so that his tiny black shoes\nSeemed not to touch the floor. With one last prayer Sobbed in the Spanish of before the Inquisition\nHe stopped, exhausted, and looked in the dead man\u2019s face.\nPanting, he raised both arms in a mystic gesture And said, \u201cArise and breathe!\u201d And still the body\nLay as before. Impossible to tell\nIn words how Elliot\u2019s eyebrows flailed and snorted Like shaggy mammoths as \u2013 the Chinese widow\nGranting permission \u2013 the little rabbi sang\nThe blessing for performing a circumcision And removed the dead man\u2019s foreskin, chanting blessings\nIn Finnish and Swahili, and bathed the corpse\nFrom head to foot, and with a final prayer In Babylonian, gasping with exhaustion,\nHe seized the dead man\u2019s head and kissed the lips\nAnd dropped it again and leaping back commanded, \u201cArise and breathe!\u201d The corpse lay still as ever.\nAt this, as when Bash\u014d\u2019s disciples wind\nAlong the curving spine that links the renga Across the different voices, each one adding\nA transformation according to the rules\nOf stasis and repetition, all in order And yet impossible to tell beforehand,\nElliot changes for the punchline: the wee\nRabbi, still panting, like a startled boxer, Looks at the dead one, then up at all those watching,\nA kind of Mel Brooks gesture: \u201cHoo boy!\u201d he says,\n\u201cNow that\u2019s what I call really dead.\u201d O mortal Powers and princes of earth, and you immortal\nLords of the underground and afterlife,\nJehovah, Raa, Bol-Morah, Hecate, Pluto, What has a brilliant, living soul to do with\nYour harps and fires and boats, your bric-a-brac\nAnd troughs of smoking blood? Provincial stinkers, Our languages don\u2019t touch you, you\u2019re like that mother\nWhose small child entertained her to beg her life.\nPossibly he grew up to be the tall rabbi, The one who washed his hands of all those capers\nRight at the outset. Or maybe he became\nThe author of these lines, a one-man renga The one for whom it seems to be impossible\nTo tell a story straight.

  "text": "\u00a0 We were supposed to do a job in Italy\nand, full of our feeling for ourselves,\nour sense of being\nPoets from America, we went\nfrom Rome to Fano, met the mayor,\nposed for the photographers and served\non panels (\u201cWhat does it mean, \u2018flat drink\u2019?\u201d asked someone.\n\u201cWhat does it mean, \u2018cheap date\u2019?\u201d.)\nAmong Italian literati we could recognize our counterparts \u2013\nthe academic, the apologist,\nthe arrogant, the amorous,\nthe brazen and the glib \u2013 and there was one administrator (the conservative) in suit\nof regulation gray who like a good tour guide\nwith measured pace and uninflected tone narrated\nsights and histories the hired van hauled us past.\nOf all, he was most politic, and least poetic,\nso it seemed. Our last few days in Rome,\n(when all but three of the New World Bards had flown)\nI found a book of poems this\nunprepossessing one had written. It was there\nin the pensione room (a room he\u2019d recommended)\nwhere it must have been abandoned by\nthe German visitor (was there a bus of them?)\nto whom he had inscribed and dated it a month before.\nI couldn\u2019t read Italian either, so I put the book\nback in the wardrobe\u2019s dark. We last Americans were due to leave tomorrow. For our parting evening then\nour host chose something in a family restaurant, and\nthere we sat and chatted, sat and chewed\ntill, sensible it was our last\nbig chance to be poetic, make\nour mark one of us asked\n\u201cWhat\u2019s poetry?\nIs it the fruits and vegetables and\nmarketplace of Campo dei Fiori? Or\nthe statue there?\u201d Because I was the glib one, I identified the answer\ninstantly, I didn\u2019t have to think \u2013 \u201cThe truth\nis both, it\u2019s both!\u201d I blurted out. But that\nwas easy. That was easiest to say. What followed\ntaught me something about difficulty,\nfor our underestimated host spoke out,\nall of a sudden, with a rising passion, and he said: That statue represents Giordano Bruno,\nbrought to be burned in the public square\nbecause of his offense against\nauthority, which was to say\nthe Church. His crime was his belief\nthe universe does not revolve around\nthe human being: God is no\nfixed point or central government, but rather is\npoured in waves through all things. All things\nmove. \u2018If God is not the soul itself, He is\nthe soul of the soul of the world.\u2019 Such was\nhis heresy. The day they brought him\nforth to die, they feared he might\nincite the crowd (the man was famous\nfor his eloquence). And so his captors\nplaced upon his face\nan iron mask, in which he could not speak. That is\nhow they burned him. That is how\nhe died, without a word, in front\nof everyone.\nAnd poetry \u2013\n(we\u2019d all\nput down our forks by now, to listen to\nthe man in gray; he went on\nsoftly) \u2013\npoetry is what he thought but did not say.",

In my clear rivers my own men discerned\nThe motive for the ruin and the crime \u2013\nGold heavier than earth, a wealth unearned,\nLoot, for two decades, from the heart of Time. Metal, intrinsic value, deep and dense,\nPreanimate, inimitable, still,\nReal, but an evil with no human sense,\nDispersed the mind to concentrate the will. Grained by alchemic change, the human kind\nTurned from themselves to rivers and to rocks;\nWith dynamite broke metal unrefined;\nMeasured their moods by geologic shocks. With knives they dug the metal out of stone;\nTurned rivers back, for gold through ages piled,\nDrove knives to hearts, and faced the gold alone;\nValley and river ruined and reviled; Reviled and ruined me, my servant slew,\nStrangled him from the figtree by my door.\nWhen they had done what fury bade them do,\nI was a cursing beggar, stripped and sore. What end impersonal, what breathless age,\nIncontinent of quiet and of years,\nWhat calm catastrophe will yet assuage\nThis final drouth of penitential tears?",

Importance of looking bad or good. Did he see anything like the prisoner on a leash? Yes,\nIn Afghanistan. In Guant?namo he was isolated. Our enemies \u201cdisassemble\u201d says the President.\nNot that anyone at all couldn\u2019t mis-speak. The profesores created nicknames for torture devices:\nThe Airplane. The Frog. Burping the Baby. Not that those who behead the helpless in the name\nOf God or tradition don\u2019t also write poetry. Guilts, metaphors, traditions. Hunger strikes.\nCulture the penalty. Culture the escape. What could your children boast about you? What\nWill your father say, down among the shades? The Sangomo told Marvin, \u201cYou are crushed by some\nWeight. Only your own Ancestors can help you.\u201d",

  "text": "\u00a0 Snake River Country I now remembered slowly how I came,\nI, sometime living, sometime with a name,\nCreeping by iron ways across the bare\nWastes of Wyoming, turning in despair,\nChanging and turning, till the fall of night,\nThen throbbing motionless with iron might.\nFour days and nights! Small stations by the way,\nSunk far past midnight! Nothing one can say\nNames the compassion they stir in the heart.\nObscure men shift and cry, and we depart. And I remembered with the early sun\nThat foul-mouthed barber back in Pendleton,\nThe sprawling streets, the icy station bench,\nThe Round-up pennants, the latrinal stench.\nThese towns are cold by day, the flesh of vice\nRaw and decisive, and the will precise;\nAt night the turbulence of drink and mud,\nBlue glare of gas, the dances dripping blood,\nFists thudding murder in the shadowy air,\nExhausted whores, sunk to a changeless stare.\nAlive in empty fact alone, extreme,\nThey make each fact a mortuary dream. Once when the train paused in an empty place,\nI met the unmoved landscape face to face;\nSmoothing abysses that no stream could slake,\nDeep in its black gulch crept the heavy Snake,\nThe sound diffused, and so intently firm,\nIt seemed the silence, having change nor term.\nBeyond the river, gray volcanic stone\nIn rolling hills: the river moved alone.\nAnd when we started, charged with mass, and slow,\nWe hung against it in an awful flow. Thus I proceeded until early night,\nAnd, when I read the station\u2019s name aright,\nDescended \u2013 at the bidding of a word!\nI slept the night out where the thought occurred,\nThen rose to view the dwelling where I lay.\nOutside, the bare land stretching far away;\nThe frame house, new, fortuitous, and bright,\nPointing the presence of the morning light;\nA train\u2019s far screaming, clean as shining steel\nPlaning the distance for the gliding heel.\nThrough shrinking frost, autumnal grass uncurled,\nIn naked sunlight, on a naked world.",

Suppose I take an arrogant bomber, stroke\nBy stroke, up to the frazzled sun to hear\nSun-ghostlings whisper: Yes, the capital yoke \u2013\nRemove it and there\u2019s not a ghost to fear\nThis crucial day, whose decapitate joke\nLanguidly winds into the inner ear. \u00a0 II The day\u2019s at end and there\u2019s nowhere to go,\nDraw to the fire, even this fire is dying;\nGet up and once again politely lying\nInvite the ladies toward the mistletoe\nWith greedy eyes that stare like an old crow.\nHow pleasantly the holly wreaths did hang\nAnd how stuffed Santa did his reindeer clang\nAbove the golden oaken mantel, years ago! Then hang this picture for a calendar,\nAs sheep for goat, and pray most fixedly\nFor the cold martial progress of your star,\nWith thoughts of commerce and society,\nWell-milked Chinese, Negroes who cannot sing,\nThe Huns gelded and feeding in a ring. \u00a0 III Give me this day a faith not personal\nAs follows: The American people fully armed\nWith assurance policies, righteous and harmed,\nBattle the world of which they\u2019re not at all.\nThat lying boy of ten who stood in the hall,\nHis hat in hand (thus by his father charmed:\n\u201cYou may be President\u201d), was not alarmed\nNor even left uneasy by his fall. Nobody said that he could be a plumber,\nCarpenter, clerk, bus-driver, bombardier;\nLet little boys go into violent slumber,\nAegean squall and squalor where their fear\nIs of an enemy in remote oceans\nUnstalked by Christ: these are the better notions. \u00a0 IV Citizen, myself, or personal friend,\nYour ghosts are Plato\u2019s Christians in the cave.\nUnfix your necks, turn to the door; the nave\nGives back the cheated and light dividend\nSo long sequestered; now, new-rich, you\u2019ll spend\nFlesh for reality inside a stone\nWhose light obstruction, like a gossamer bone,\nDead or still living, will not break or bend. Thus light, your flesh made pale and sinister\nAnd put off like a dog that\u2019s had his day,\nYou will be Plato\u2019s darlings, and you sir\nAlbino man bleached from the mortal clay,\nMild-mannered, gifted in your master\u2019s ease\nWhile the sun squats upon the waveless seas.",

On either side, those dear old ladies,\nthe loosening barns, their little windows\ndulled by cataracts of hay and cobwebs\nhide broken tractors under their skirts. So this is Nebraska. A Sunday\nafternoon; July. Driving along\nwith your hand out squeezing the air,\na meadowlark waiting on every post. Behind a shelterbelt of cedars,\ntop-deep in hollyhocks, pollen and bees,\na pickup kicks its fenders off\nand settles back to read the clouds. You feel like that; you feel like letting\nyour tires go flat, like letting the mice\nbuild a nest in your muffler, like being\nno more than a truck in the weeds, clucking with chickens or sticky with honey\nor holding a skinny old man in your lap\nwhile he watches the road, waiting\nfor someone to wave to. You feel like waving. You feel like stopping the car\nand dancing around on the road. You wave\ninstead and leave your hand out gliding\nlarklike over the wheat, over the houses.",

Old old old.\nNot homekind Oldness!

The Ladies look,\nIn horror, behind a substantial citizeness\nWhose trains clank out across her swollen heart.\nWho, arms akimbo, almost fills a door.\nAll tumbling children, quilts dragged to the floor\nAnd tortured thereover, potato peelings, soft-\nEyed kitten, hunched-up, haggard, to-be-hurt.\nTheir League is allotting largesse to the Lost.\nBut to put their clean, their pretty money, to put\nTheir money collected from delicate rose-fingers\nTipped with their hundred flawless rose-nails seems . . .\nThey own Spode, Lowestoft, candelabra,\nMantels, and hostess gowns, and sunburst clocks,\nTurtle soup, Chippendale, red satin \u201changings,\u201d\nAubussons and Hattie Carnegie.

This sick four-story hulk, this fibre\nWith fissures everywhere! Why, what are bringings\nOf loathe-love largesse? What shall peril hungers\nSo old old, what shall flatter the desolate?\nTin can, blocked fire escape and chitterling\nAnd swaggering seeking youth and the puzzled wreckage\nOf the middle passage, and urine and stale shames\nAnd, again, the porridges of the underslung\nAnd children children children. Heavens! That\nWas a rat, surely, off there, in the shadows? Long\nAnd long-tailed? Gray? The Ladies from the Ladies\u2019\nBetterment League agree it will be better\nTo achieve the outer air that rights and steadies,\nTo hie to a house that does not holler, to ring\nBells elsetime, better presently to cater\nTo no more Possibilities, to get\nAway. Perhaps the money can be posted.\nPerhaps they two may choose another Slum!\nSome serious sooty half-unhappy home! \u2013\nWhere loathe-love likelier may be invested.\nKeeping their scented bodies in the center\nOf the hall as they walk down the hysterical hall,\nThey allow their lovely skirts to graze no wall,\nAre off at what they manage of a canter,\nAnd, resuming all the clues of what they were,\nTry to avoid inhaling the laden air.",

The water will always fall, and will not fall,\nAnd the tipped bell make no sound.\nThe grass will always be growing for hay\nDeep on the ground. And I shall stand here like a shadow\nUnder the great balanced day,\nMy eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the wind,\nAnd does not drift away.",

  "text": "\u00a0 Brooklyn, 1929. Of course Crane\u2019s\nbeen drinking and has no idea who\nthis curious Andalusian is, unable\neven to speak the language of poetry.\nThe young man who brought them\ntogether knows both Spanish and English,\nbut he has a headache from jumping\nback and forth from one language\nto another. For a moment\u2019s relief\nhe goes to the window to look\ndown on the East River, darkening\nbelow as the early light comes on.\nSomething flashes across his sight,\na double vision of such horror\nhe has to slap both his hands across\nhis mouth to keep from screaming.\nLet\u2019s not be frivolous, let\u2019s\nnot pretend the two poets gave\neach other wisdom or love or\neven a good time, let\u2019s not\ninvent a dialogue of such eloquence\nthat even the ants in your own\nhouse won\u2019t forget it. The two\ngreatest poetic geniuses alive\nmeet, and what happens? A vision\ncomes to an ordinary man staring\nat a filthy river. Have you ever\nhad a vision? Have you ever shaken\nyour head to pieces and jerked back\nat the image of your young son\nfalling through open space, not\nfrom the stern of a ship bound\nfrom Vera Cruz to New York but from\nthe roof of the building he works on?\nHave you risen from bed to pace\nuntil dawn to beg a merciless God\nto take these pictures away? Oh, yes,\nlet\u2019s bless the imagination. It gives\nus the myths we live by. Let\u2019s bless\nthe visionary power of the human \u2013\nthe only animal that\u2019s got it -,\nbless the exact image of your father\ndead and mine dead, bless the images\nthat stalk the corners of our sight\nand will not let go. The young man\nwas my cousin, Arthur Lieberman,\nthen a language student at Columbia,\nwho told me all this before he died\nquietly in his sleep in 1983\nin a hotel in Perugia. A good man,\nArthur, he survived graduate school,\nlater came home to Detroit and sold\npianos right through the Depression.\nHe loaned my brother a used one\nto compose his hideous songs on,\nwhich Arthur thought were genius.\nWhat an imagination Arthur had!",

  "text": "Then one morning you\u2019re tying your shoelaces\nAnd there they are, two more-than-cracks in your favourite shoe\nWhich couldn\u2019t have been there the day before; or are you past\nObserving details so close to home? And, yes,\nFor leather suddenly to give out without warning is unsettling\n(Though, on reflection this is how things happen; for how terrifying\nTo base your philosophy on anticipating surprise and Accident!)Nevertheless the unease will not confine itself to shoes. So of course you go back to the bathroom mirror\n(Remembering the betrayal in that hotel room\nWhen an unaccustomed arrangement of glass caught you unawares,\nShowed you shapes your vanity never knew):\nYou go back to the mirror and test your courage\nOn a safe bit of self. Not quite as before but it knows \u2013 surely,\nSomething: the god of biology knows \u2013 this can\u2019t be replaced\nAs easily as shoes. So what to do? You vow to take more care of the shoes.",

But that was Before \u2013\nYes, we\u2019ve had too many images of After \u2013\nThat was when, on a Sunday afternoon after church,\nAnancyman came to the house and arranged a sitting:\nIn the drawing-room a detail of her dress is out of place. ii No, of course, you do not understand. I come back to this scene\nDecades later on a day in Sheffield laid out to be painted.\nI pause in mid-stride, the rinsed landscape too clean for February;\nThe bruised sky of yesterday clearing up, a scent of elsewhere drifting\nIndoors, from the garden. I think of men in berets and cravats\nAt the salon \u2013 of a provincial Degas whose aim was to trap you dancing,\nOr an island Renoir with no fear and hatred of women;\nOf your afterlife drawing suitors to worship at Orsay and Marmottan. iii So, yes, I\u2019m thinking back to the small accident in the churchyard\n(Sermons do not prepare you for the dangers of uneven ground);\nAnd then to your pampered ankle after lunch, caught on canvas,\nAlong with the vicar an d the headmaster providing the conversation.\nThe boy with the made-up name was praised for the likeness\nOf the bandage on the lady\u2019s foot; he could have been a medic as well\nAs artist. Not bad, you said, the sternest judge. And then you asked:\nBut how are you going to paint my other shoe, over it?",

Does it matter?\nI spoke a tongue that was passed on\nTo me in the place I happened to be,\nA place huddled between grey walls\nOf cloud for at least half the year.\nMy word for heaven was not yours.\nThe word for hell had a sharp edge\nPut on it by the hand of the wind\nHoning, honing with a shrill sound\nDay and night. Nothing that Glyn Dwr\nKnew was armour against the rain\u2019s\nMissiles. What was descent from him? Even God had a Welsh name:\nHe spoke to him in the old language;\nHe was to have a peculiar care\nFor the Welsh people. History showed us\nHe was too big to be nailed to the wall\nOf a stone chapel, yet still we crammed him\nBetween the boards of a black book. Yet men sought us despite this.\nMy high cheek-bones, my length of skull\nDrew them as to a rare portrait\nBy a dead master. I saw them stare\nFrom their long cars, as I passed knee-deep\nIn ewes and wethers. I saw them stand\nBy the thorn hedges, watching me string\nThe far flocks on a shrill whistle.\nAnd always there was their eyes; strong\nPressure on me: You are Welsh, they said;\nSpeak to us so; keep your fields free\nOf the smell of petrol, the loud roar\nOf hot tractors; we must have peace\nAnd quietness. Is a museum\nPeace? I asked. Am I the keeper\nOf the heart\u2019s relics, blowing the dust\nIn my own eyes? I am a man;\nI never wanted the drab role\nLife assigned me, an actor playing\nTo the past\u2019s audience upon a stage\nOf earth and stone; the absurd label\nOf birth, of race hanging askew\nAbout my shoulders. I was in prison\nUntil you came; your voice was a key\nTurning in the enormous lock\nOf hopelessness. Did the door open\nTo let me out or yourselves in?",

When he lived, tall factory hooters never summoned him.\nNor did restaurant plate-glass doors revolve to wave him in.\nHis name never appeared in the papers.\nThe world maintained its traditional wall\nRound the dead with their gold sunk deep as a well,\nWhilst his life, intangible as a Stock Exchange rumour, drifted outside. O too lightly he threw down his cap\nOne day when the breeze threw petals from the trees.\nThe unflowering wall sprouted with guns,\nMachine-gun anger quickly scythed the grasses;\nFlags and leaves fell from hands and branches;\nThe tweed cap rotted in the nettles. Consider his life which was valueless\nIn terms of employment, hotel ledgers, news files.\nConsider. One bullet in ten thousand kills a man.\nAsk. Was so much expenditure justified\nOn the death of one so young and so silly\nLying under the olive trees, O world, O death?",

Or am\nI greedy to make you up\nAgain out of memory?\nAre you there at all?\nI would like to think\nYou were all right\nAnd not worried about\nMonica and the children\nAnd not unhappy or bored 2 Speaking to you and not\nKnowing if you are there\nIs not too difficult.\nMy words are used to that.\nDo you want anything?\nWhere shall I send something?\nRice-wine, meanders, paintings\nBy your contemporaries?\nOr shall I send a kind\nOf news of no time\nLeaning against the wall\nOutside your old house. The house and the whole moor\nIs flying in the mist. 3 I am up. I\u2019ve washed\nThe front of my face\nAnd here I stand looking\nOut over the top\nHalf of my bedroom window.\nThere almost as far\nAs I can see I see\nSt Buryan\u2019s church tower.\nAn inch to the left, behind\nThat dark rise of woods,\nIs where you used to lurk. 4 This is only a note\nTo say I am aware\nYou are not here. I find\nIt difficult to go\nBeside Housman\u2019s star\nLit fences without you.\nAnd nobody will laugh\nAt my jokes like you. 5 Bryan, I would be obliged\nIf you would scout things out\nFor me. Although I am not\nJust ready to start out.\nI am trying to be better,\nWhich will make you smile\nUnder your blue hat. I know I make a symbol\nOf the foxglove on the wall.\nIt is because it knows you.",

  "text": "Every now and then one writes a poem which seems in some way significant to one's own development as a poet. 'Song of the Battery Hen' is, for me, such a poem. It seems to combine the taut, claustrophobic atmosphere of my domestic poems, with a wider, more social comment. It was written last year when I was staying on a farm in Worcestershire. The farmer showed me his battery house with some pride and when I made the usual clich?d comment about the poor bloody hens he said \"Do you know we had an experiment one day, we left the flaps of all the cages up to see what the hens would do. Well they looked, then they walked to the edge of the cages then they looked around and walked straight back in.\" At that point I said to myself, \"Christ, he's just written my autobiography\" and that afternoon I wrote 'Song of the Battery Hen'. Song of the Battery Hen We can't grumble about accommodation:\tWe have a new concrete floor that's\tAlways dry, four walls that are\tPainted white, and a sheet-iron roof\tThe rain drums on. A fan blows warm air\tBeneath our feet to disperse the smell\tOf chickenshit and, on dull days,\tFluorescent lighting sees us. You can tell me: if you come by\tThe North door, I am in the twelfth pen\tOn the left-hand side of the third row\tFrom the floor; and in that pen\tI am usually the middle one of three.\tBut even without directions, you'd\tDiscover me. I have the same orange-\tRed comb, yellow beak and auburn\tFeathers, but as the door opens and you\tHear above the electric fan a kind of\tOne-word wail, I am the one\tWho sounds loudest in my head.",

  "text": "There are many cumbersome ways to kill a man:\nyou can make him carry a plank of wood\nto the top of a hill and nail him to it. To do this\nproperly you require a crowd of people\nwearing sandals, a cock that crows, a cloak\nto dissect, a sponge, some vinegar and one\nman to hammer the nails home. Or you can take a length of steel,\nshaped and chased in a traditional way,\nand attempt to pierce the metal cage he wears.\nBut for this you need white horses,\nEnglish trees, men with bows and arrows,\nat least two flags, a prince and a\ncastle to hold your banquet in. Dispensing with nobility, you may, if the wind\nallows, blow gas at him. But then you need\na mile of mud sliced through with ditches,\nnot to mention black boots, bomb craters,\nmore mud, a plague of rats, a dozen songs\nand some round hats made of steel. In an age of aeroplanes, you may fly\nmiles above your victim and dispose of him by\npressing one small switch. All you then\nrequire is an ocean to separate you, two\nsystems of government, a nation\u2019s scientists,\nseveral factories, a psychopath and\nland that no one needs for several years. These are, as I began, cumbersome ways\nto kill a man. Simpler, direct, and much more neat\nis to see that he is living somewhere in the middle\nof the twentieth century, and leave him there.",

With generals and lame privates both\nSuch charms worked wonders, till\nThe show was over \u2013 lagging loth\nWe faced the sunset chill; And standing on the sandy way,\nWith the cracked church peering past,\nWe heard another matin?e,\nWe heard the maniac blast Of barrage south by Saint Eloi,\nAnd the red lights flaming there\nCalled madness: Come, my bonny boy,\nAnd dance to the latest air. To this new concert, white we stood;\nCold certainty held our breath;\nWhile men in the tunnels below Larch Wood\nWere kicking men to death. I would perhaps add the detail that this was the case \u2013 that Larchwood was a famous tunnel system of ours \u2013 the Germans got in and the only weapons at hand for many of the miners were their feet or fists.

We ran\nBehind the backs of houses, crossed a street\nOf blinding windscreens, smelt the fish-dock; thence\nThe river\u2019s level drifting breadth began,\nWhere sky and Lincolnshire and water meet. All afternoon, through the tall heat that slept\nFor miles inland,\nA slow and stopping curve southwards we kept.\nWide farms went by, short-shadowed cattle, and\nCanals with floatings of industrial froth;\nA hothouse flashed uniquely: hedges dipped\nAnd rose: and now and then a smell of grass\nDisplaced the reek of buttoned carriage-cloth\nUntil the next town, new and nondescript,\nApproached with acres of dismantled cars. At first, I didn\u2019t notice what a noise\nThe weddings made\nEach station that we stopped at: sun destroys\nThe interest of what\u2019s happening in the shade,\nAnd down the long cool platforms whoops and skirls\nI took for porters larking with the mails,\nAnd went on reading. Once we started, though,\nWe passed them, grinning and pomaded, girls\nIn parodies of fashion, heels and veils,\nAll posed irresolutely, watching us go, As if out on the end of an event\nWaving goodbye\nTo something that survived it. Struck, I leant\nMore promptly out next time, more curiously,\nAnd saw it all again in different terms:\nThe fathers with broad belts under their suits\nAnd seamy foreheads; mothers loud and fat;\nAn uncle shouting smut; and then the perms,\nThe nylon gloves and jewellery-substitutes,\nThe lemons, mauves, and olive-ochres that Marked off the girls unreally from the rest.\nYes, from cafes\nAnd banquet-halls up yards, and bunting-dressed\nCoach-party annexes, the wedding-days\nWere coming to an end. All down the line\nFresh couples climbed aboard: the rest stood round;\nThe last confetti and advice were thrown,\nAnd, as we moved, each face seemed to define\nJust what it saw departing: children frowned\nAt something dull; fathers had never known Success so huge and wholly farcical;\nThe women shared\nThe secret like a happy funeral;\nWhile girls, gripping their handbags tighter, stared\nAt a religious wounding. Free at last,\nAnd loaded with the sum of all they saw,\nWe hurried towards London, shuffling gouts of steam.\nNow fields were building-plots and poplars cast\nLong shadows over major roads, and for\nSome fifty minutes, that in time would seem Just long enough to settle hats and say\nI nearly died,\nA dozen marriages got under way.\nThey watched the landscape, sitting side by side\n\u2013 An Odeon went past, a cooling tower,\nAnd someone running up to bowl \u2013 and none\nThought of the others they would never meet\nOr how their lives would all contain this hour.\nI thought of London spread out in the sun,\nIts postal districts packed like squares of wheat: There we were aimed. And as we raced across\nBright knots of rail\nPast standing Pullmans, walls of blackened moss\nCame close, and it was nearly done, this frail\nTravelling coincidence; and what it held\nStood ready to be loosed with all the power\nThat being changed can give. We slowed again,\nAnd as the tightened brakes took hold, there swelled\nA sense of falling, like an arrow-shower\nSent out of sight, somewhere becoming rain.",

Moly Nightmare of beasthood, snorting, how to wake.\nI woke. What beasthood skin she made me take? Leathery toad that ruts for days on end,\nOr cringing dribbling dog, man\u2019s servile friend, Or cat that prettily pounces on its meat,\nTortures it hours, then does not care to eat: Parrot, moth, shark, wolf, crocodile, ass, flea.\nWhat germs, what jostling mobs there were in me. These seem like bristles, and the hide is tough.\nNo claw or web here: each foot ends in hoof. Into what bulk has method disappeared?\nLike ham, streaked. I am gross\u2013grey, gross, flap-eared. The pale-lashed eyes my only human feature.\nMy teeth tear, tear. I am the snouted creature That bites through anything, root, wire, or can.\nIf I was not afraid I\u2019d eat a man. Oh a man\u2019s flesh already is in mine.\nHand and foot poised for risk. Buried in swine. I root and root, you think that it is greed,\nIt is, but I seek out a plant I need. Direct me, gods, whose changes are all holy\nTo where it flickers deep in grass, the moly: Cool flesh of magic in each leaf and shoot,\nFrom milky flower to the black forked root. From this fat dungeon I could rise to skin\nAnd human title, putting pig within. I push my big grey wet snout through the green,\nDreaming of the flower I have never seen.",

  "text": "Pitter: Yes, indeed. A very big element of that obscurity which is one of the mysteries and one of the glories of poetry, because labour as we may and labour as we must we can\u2019t tell really from whence it comes, and this is why I have always honoured the noble obscurity of poetry and deprecated the slovenly obscurity: I would clear away every slovenly obscurity I could and labour to make myself as clear as my plain meaning could be carried in order that the noble obscurities, if they come, may have their full weight and value. Because even in scraps and crumbs of poetry, in bits of old ballads, bits of ballads that Shakespeare embeds for instance \u2013 they make one\u2019s flesh creep with this mystery which is as much of the flesh as the spirit I think: \u201cChilde Rowland to the dark tower came\u201d \u2013 he felt it too or he wouldn\u2019t have so embedded them into his text. And such phrases as \u201cHow should I your true love know?\u201d beyond their content, their plain meaning, there are depths of mystery, of obscurity if you like, and this is one of the major characteristics of poetry, one of its great raison d\u2019\u1ec7tres and something we should be thankful for when it comes, and which we should labour to make clear and not to let anything slovenly through, so the thing itself, when it suddenly appears, may be seen to appear. Interviewer: Yes, precisely \u2013 one\u2019s objections to slovenly or pretentious obscurity is not that one thinks poetry should be crystal clear, but that the real complexities of it are hidden under the clutter. Well this is something that one finds no trace of in your work at all \u2013 there is never any of this, as it were, secondary obscurity, all the obscurities are there in the nature of the experience that\u2019s being treated. If you take a poem like this one, \u2018If You Came\u2019 \u2013 would you read us that one? \u2018If You Came\u2019? Pitter: Gladly. If You Came If you came to my secret glade, Weary with heat, I would set you down in the shade I would wash your feet.  If you came in the winter sad, Wanting for bread, I would give you the last that I had, I would give you my bed.   But the place is hidden apart Like a nest by a brook, And I will not show you my heart By a word, by a look.   The place is hidden apart Like the nest of a bird: And I will not show you my heartBy a look, by a word.",

I touch its tender hips, its dark jawed face,\nits solid neck, its brown sleep. True. There is\na beautiful Jesus.\nHe is frozen to his bones like a chunk of beef.\nHow desperately he wanted to pull his arms in!\nHow desperately I touch his vertical and horizontal axes!\nBut I can\u2019t. Need is not quite belief. All morning long\nI have worn\nyour cross, hung with package string around my throat.\nIt tapped me lightly as a child\u2019s heart might,\ntapping secondhand, softly waiting to be born.\nRuth, I cherish the letter you wrote. My friend, my friend, I was born\ndoing reference work in sin, and born\nconfessing it. This is what poems are:\nwith mercy\nfor the greedy,\nthey are the tongue\u2019s wrangle,\nthe world\u2019s pottage, the rat\u2019s star. Interviewer: One of the things that\u2019s particularly interesting about this is the dedication I think, and the poem\u2019s preoccupation with religion \u2013 were you brought up in any particular religion realistically? Sexton: Yes, a protestant one. Interviewer: A protestant one? Sexton: Yes Interviewer: In your poems there sometimes seems to be a special sort of preoccupation with ritual of a sort that I suppose is not very common to Protestantism. Sexton: No, I think I\u2019m rather attracted to Catholicism and everyone thinks that I was a Catholic and that I left the church and now I tell everyone I\u2019m an atheist. No one knows what I am, but I think I have a great preoccupation with Catholicism. All on my own, with no influence whatsoever. Interviewer: It\u2019s interesting that you can say, well I\u2019m an atheist, quite surely, and at the same time have this preoccupation because\u2026 Sexton: This is an obsession though, you see, and I\u2019m not sure where it leads to. I even answer it in this poem by saying it is poems that have done it for me, poems are my religion. That\u2019s my answer in the poem. Interviewer: You do come back, not only in this poem but in some others, though to very realistic details about certain features of Christianity like the crucifixion \u2013 you say \u201cThere is a beautiful Jesus, he is frozen to his bones like a chunk of beef.\u201d Well this reminds one of certain sorts of very moving religious paintings in which the actual physical suffering of Christ on the cross is very present. Sexton: Well I\u2019m very aware of this all the time, I am very influenced by Christ and the physical suffering, perhaps more attracted to the suffering than the rising. Interviewer: The human side of it in fact. Sexton: Yes the human being there on the cross. Interviewer: But yet you\u2019ve never felt moved to become\u2026to convert to Catholicism or to any other religion. Sexton: I\u2019ve thought of it and even tried it but it hasn\u2019t worked. I\u2019m still a sceptic. Interviewer: Indeed this poem is about\u2026 Sexton:\u2026about that, being a sceptic, but saying all I have to give to Christ is my poem.",

  "text": "February 17th A lamb could not get born. Ice wind\nOut of a downpour dishclout sunrise. The mother\nLay on the muddied slope. Harried, she got up\nAnd the blackish lump bobbed at her back-end\nUnder her tail. After some hard galloping,\nSome manoeuvering, much flapping of the backward\nLump head of the lamb looking out,\nI caught her with a rope. Laid her, head uphill\nAnd examined the lamb. A blood-ball swollen\nTight in its black felt, its mouth gap\nSquashed crooked, tongue stuck out, black-purple,\nStrangled by its mother. I felt inside,\nPast the noose of mother-flesh, into the slippery\nMuscled tunnel, fingering for a hoof,\nRight back to the port-hole of the pelvis.\nBut there was no hoof. He had stuck his head out too early\nAnd his feet could not follow. He should have\nFelt his way, tip-toe, his toes\nTucked up under his nose\nFor a safe landing. So I kneeled wrestling\nWith her groans. No hand could squeeze past\nThe lamb\u2019s neck into her interior\nTo hook a knee. I roped that baby head\nAnd hauled till she cried out and tried\nTo get up and I saw it was useless. I went\nTwo miles for the injection and a razor.\nSliced the lamb\u2019s throat-strings, levered with a knife\nBetween the vertebrae and brought the head off\nTo stare at its mother, its pipes sitting in the mud\nWith all earth for a body. Then pushed\nThe neck-stump right back in, and as I pushed\nShe pushed. She pushed crying and I pushed gasping.\nAnd the strength\nOf the birth push and the push of my thumb\nAgainst that wobbly vertebrae were deadlock,\nA to-fro futility. Till I forced\nA hand past and got a knee. Then like\nPulling myself to the ceiling with one finger\nHooked in a loop, timing my effort\nTo her birth push groans, I pulled against\nThe corpse that would not come. Till it came,\nAnd after it the long, sudden, yolk-yellow\nParcel of life\nIn a smoking slither of oils and soups and syrups \u2013\nAnd the body lay born, beside the hacked-off head.",

Parking spaces luxuriate like civic\nsandpiles in the heart of Boston.\nA girdle of orange, Puritan-pumpkin colored girders\nbraces the tingling Statehouse, shaking over the excavations, as it faces Colonel Shaw\nand his bell-cheeked Negro infantry\non St. Gaudens\u2019 shaking Civil War relief,\npropped by a plank splint against the garage\u2019s earthquake. Two months after marching through Boston,\nhalf the regiment was dead;\nat the dedication,\nWilliam James could almost hear the bronze Negroes breathe. Their monument sticks like a fishbone\nin the city\u2019s throat.\nIts Colonel is as lean\nas a compass-needle. He has an angry wrenlike vigilance,\na greyhound\u2019s gentle tautness;\nhe seems to wince at pleasure,\nand suffocate for privacy. He is out of bounds now. He rejoices in man\u2019s lovely,\npeculiar power to choose life and die \u2013\nwhen he leads his black soldiers to death,\nhe cannot bend his back. On a thousand small town New England greens,\nthe old white churches hold their air\nof sparse, sincere rebellion; frayed flags\nquilt the graveyards of the Grand Army of the Republic. The stone statues of the abstract Union Soldier\ngrow slimmer and younger each year \u2013\nwasp-waisted, they doze over muskets\nand muse through their sideburns . . . Shaw\u2019s father wanted no monument\nexcept the ditch,\nwhere his son\u2019s body was thrown\nand lost with his \u201cniggers.\u201d The ditch is nearer.\nThere are no statues for the last war here;\non Boylston Street, a commercial photograph\nshows Hiroshima boiling over a Mosler Safe, the \u201cRock of Ages\u201d\nthat survived the blast. Space is nearer.\nWhen I crouch to my television set,\nthe drained faces of Negro school-children rise like balloons. Colonel Shaw\nis riding on his bubble,\nhe waits\nfor the bless?d break. The Aquarium is gone. Everywhere,\ngiant finned cars nose forward like fish;\na savage servility\nslides by on grease. Interviewer: Did you have Alan Tate\u2019s \u2018Confederate Dead Ode\u2019 in mind when you wrote it or did you just change\u2026you rather imply you changed the title\u2026 Lowell: Well I remember we had arguments then\u2026I have somewhat two minds about the Civil War \u2013 I wish it hadn\u2019t been fought \u2013 but I know arguing with southerners I do sometimes say it matters that we were right. And it gets under your skin a little bit that there\u2019s so much southern celebration of the Civil War and none in the North which lost as many men as the South did. I think our two poems reflect the difference \u2013 that it was a different war for the South, not a war of ideas and freeing the slaves \u2013 anything as abstract as the Union wouldn\u2019t come into the southern war. It\u2019s easier perhaps to write from the southern point of view. So a northern poem couldn\u2019t be like Tate\u2019s \u2018Confederate Dead\u2019, sort of musing on the heroic past \u2013 I think you\u2019d have to bring in what the war was fought for and the meter\u2026his is very\u2026I\u2019m crazy about his poem and it\u2019s a very grand piece of sounding, very\u2026 \u2013 mine the trick was to make it look almost prosy then have it rise in places. Interviewer: It has a sort of dying fall rhetoric doesn\u2019t it \u2013 a splendid piece in its own way. But I can see you couldn\u2019t very well go on to write another Union Dead. Lowell: No",

He used to sleep like a glass of water\nheld up in the hand of a very young girl.\nThen he learned he wasn\u2019t perfect, that\nno one was perfect. So he made his way\nNorth under the bland roof of a tent\ntoo small for even his lean body. The mattress ticking he shares in the work barracks\nis brown and smells\nfrom the sweat of two other men.\nOne of them chews snuff:\nhe\u2019s never met either.\nTo him, work is a narrow grief\nand the music afterwards\nis like a woman\nreaching into his chest\nto spread it around.

  "text": "I In my beginning is my end. In succession\tHouses rise and fall, crumble, are extended,\tAre removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place\tIs an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass.\tOld stone to new building, old timber to new fires,\tOld fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth\tWhich is already flesh, fur and faeces,\tBone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf.\tHouses live and die: there is a time for building\tAnd a time for living and for generation\tAnd a time for the wind to break the loosened pane\tAnd to shake the wainscot where the field-mouse trots\tAnd to shake the tattered arras woven with a silent motto. In my beginning is my end. Now the light falls\tAcross the open field, leaving the deep lane\tShuttered with branches, dark in the afternoon,\tWhere you lean against a bank while a van passes,\tAnd the deep lane insists on the direction\tInto the village, in the electric heat\tHypnotised. In a warm haze the sultry light\tIs absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone.\tThe dahlias sleep in the empty silence.\tWait for the early owl. In that open field\tIf you do not come too close, if you do not come too close,\tOn a summer midnight, you can hear the music\tOf the weak pipe and the little drum\tAnd see them dancing around the bonfire\tThe association of man and woman\tIn daunsinge, signifying matrimonie-\tA dignified and commodiois sacrament.\tTwo and two, necessarye coniunction,\tHolding eche other by the hand or the arm\tWhiche betokeneth concorde. Round and round the fire\tLeaping through the flames, or joined in circles,\tRustically solemn or in rustic laughter\tLifting heavy feet in clumsy shoes,\tEarth feet, loam feet, lifted in country mirth\tMirth of those long since under earth\tNourishing the corn. Keeping time,\tKeeping the rhythm in their dancing\tAs in their living in the living seasons\tThe time of the seasons and the constellations\tThe time of milking and the time of harvest\tThe time of the coupling of man and woman\tAnd that of beasts. Feet rising and falling.\tEating and drinking. Dung and death. Dawn points, and another day\tPrepares for heat and silence. Out at sea the dawn wind\tWrinkles and slides. I am here\tOr there, or elsewhere. In my beginning. V So here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years-\tTwenty years largely wasted, the years of l'entre deux guerres\tTrying to use words, and every attempt\tIs a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure\tBecause one has only learnt to get the better of words\tFor the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which\tOne is no longer disposed to say it. And so each venture\tIs a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate\tWith shabby equipment always deteriorating\tIn the general mess of imprecision of feeling,\tUndisciplined squads of emotion. And what there is to conquer\tBy strength and submission, has already been discovered\tOnce or twice, or several times, by men whom one cannot hope\tTo emulate \u2013 but there is no competition-\tThere is only the fight to recover what has been lost\tAnd found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions\tThat seem unpropitious. But perhaps neither gain nor loss.\tFor us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business. Home is where one starts from. As we grow older\tThe world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated\tOf dead and living. Not the intense moment\tIsolated, with no before and after,\tBut a lifetime burning in every moment\tAnd not the lifetime of one man only\tBut of old stones that cannot be deciphered.\tThere is a time for the evening under starlight,\tA time for the evening under lamplight\t(The evening with the photograph album).\tLove is most nearly itself\tWhen here and now cease to matter.\tOld men ought to be explorers\tHere or there does not matter\tWe must be still and still moving\tInto another intensity\tFor a further union, a deeper communion\tThrough the dark cold and the empty desolation,\tThe wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters\tOf the petrel and the porpoise. In my end is my beginning. Little Gidding V What we call the beginning is often the end\tAnd to make and end is to make a beginning.\tThe end is where we start from. And every phrase\tAnd sentence that is right (where every word is at home,\tTaking its place to support the others,\tThe word neither diffident nor ostentatious,\tAn easy commerce of the old and the new,\tThe common word exact without vulgarity,\tThe formal word precise but not pedantic,\tThe complete consort dancing together)\tEvery phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning,\tEvery poem an epitaph. And any action\tIs a step to the block, to the fire, down the sea's throat\tOr to an illegible stone: and that is where we start.\tWe die with the dying:\tSee, they depart, and we go with them.\tWe are born with the dead:\tSee, they return, and bring us with them.\tThe moment of the rose and the moment of the yew-tree\tAre of equal duration. A people without history\tIs not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern\tOf timeless moments. So, while the light fails\tOn a winter's afternoon, in a secluded chapel\tHistory is now and England. With the drawing of this Love and the voice of this Calling We shall not cease from exploration\tAnd the end of all our exploring\tWill be to arrive where we started\tAnd know the place for the first time.\tThrough the unknown, remembered gate\tWhen the last of earth left to discover\tIs that which was the beginning;\tAt the source of the longest river\tThe voice of the hidden waterfall\tAnd the children in the apple-tree\tNot known, because not looked for\tBut heard, half-heard, in the stillness\tBetween two waves of the sea.\tQuick now, here, now, always-\tA condition of complete simplicity\t(Costing not less than everything)\tAnd all shall be well and\tAll manner of thing shall be well\tWhen the tongues of flame are in-folded\tInto the crowned knot of fire\tAnd the fire and the rose are one.",

Then at dawn we came down to a temperate valley,\nWet, below the snow line, smelling of vegetation;\nWith a running stream and a water-mill beating the darkness,\nAnd three trees on the low sky,\nAnd an old white horse galloped away in the meadow.\nThen we came to a tavern with vine-leaves over the lintel,\nSix hands at an open door dicing for pieces of silver,\nAnd feet kicking the empty wine-skins,\nBut there was no information, and so we continued\nAnd arrived at evening, not a moment too soon\nFinding the place; it was (you may say) satisfactory. All this was a long time ago, I remember,\nAnd I would do it again, but set down\nThis set down\nThis: were we led all that way for\nBirth or Death? There was a Birth, certainly,\nWe had evidence and no doubt. I had seen birth and death,\nBut had thought they were different; this Birth was\nHard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.\nWe returned to our places, these Kingdoms,\nBut no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation,\nWith an alien people clutching their gods.\nI should be glad of another death.",

A plain without a feature, bare and brown,\nNo blade of grass, no sign of neighborhood,\nNothing to eat and nowhere to sit down,\nYet, congregated on its blankness, stood\nAn unintelligible multitude,\nA million eyes, a million boots in line,\nWithout expression, waiting for a sign. Out of the air a voice without a face\nProved by statistics that some cause was just\nIn tones as dry and level as the place:\nNo one was cheered and nothing was discussed;\nColumn by column in a cloud of dust\nThey marched away enduring a belief\nWhose logic brought them, somewhere else, to grief. She looked over his shoulder\nFor ritual pieties,\nWhite flower-garlanded heifers,\nLibation and sacrifice,\nBut there on the shining metal\nWhere the altar should have been,\nShe saw by his flickering forge-light\nQuite another scene. Barbed wire enclosed an arbitrary spot\nWhere bored officials lounged (one cracked a joke)\nAnd sentries sweated for the day was hot:\nA crowd of ordinary decent folk\nWatched from without and neither moved nor spoke\nAs three pale figures were led forth and bound\nTo three posts driven upright in the ground. The mass and majesty of this world, all\nThat carries weight and always weighs the same\nLay in the hands of others; they were small\nAnd could not hope for help and no help came:\nWhat their foes liked to do was done, their shame\nWas all the worst could wish; they lost their pride\nAnd died as men before their bodies died. She looked over his shoulder\nFor athletes at their games,\nMen and women in a dance\nMoving their sweet limbs\nQuick, quick, to music,\nBut there on the shining shield\nHis hands had set no dancing-floor\nBut a weed-choked field.\nA ragged urchin, aimless and alone,\nLoitered about that vacancy; a bird\nFlew up to safety from his well-aimed stone:\nThat girls are raped, that two boys knife a third,\nWere axioms to him, who\u2019d never heard\nOf any world where promises were kept,\nOr one could weep because another wept. The thin-lipped armorer,\nHephaestos, hobbled away,\nThetis of the shining breasts\nCried out in dismay\nAt what the god had wrought\nTo please her son, the strong\nIron-hearted man-slaying Achilles\nWho would not live long.",

It\u2019s divided into three sections, and the title sequence consists of voices from a fictitious war zone.\nThese poems ambushed me; I\u2019m not a public poet and never have been, in fact I tend to mistrust issue-driven poetry. It often seems opportunist, not least when it has a whiff of agit-prop about it. However, the sequence was written around the time of the invasion of Iraq and images of war and suffering were everywhere. I neither willed these poems nor resisted them, but it\u2019s clear that those images pressed in on me. I suspect that my versions of Goran Simic\u2019s siege poems contributed to the impulse that caused me to write \u2018Legion\u2019; I ought to stress, though, that the incidents in the poems are a construct, not drawn from reality, and the sequence was always an act of the imagination. So, this poem from \u2018Legion\u2019 is called \u2018Crapshoot\u2019. Then everything closed down, the \u2018full systems malfunction\u2019\nwe\u2019d been told to expect; a blip in the light of the world\nwas more what it was: a trip-switch on creation.

How rare it is, this place\nof living colours,\nhow wonderful,\nwhen you trust your feet\nto the slippery foreshore,\nand open your eyes. * A shingle shore\nwith a smell of salt,\nthe cry of a black-headed gull.

Love is a ditch in which the shallow drown.\nThe love of God is learning how to cope.\nSweet is the carriage in which we come to town.\nHoly the heart on which we hang our hope.",

The talk is fine.\nThere\u2019s lamplight in the corner, the glowing coal,\nLaughter from the kitchen, washing on the line.\nGourmets (fit to twist a knowing nostril) stroll\nThe happy halls. There\u2019s music. Pass the wine.\nTell of the sad derangement of the soul.\nTell of the sorrow when nations lose control. Tell of the sad derangement of the man.\nSleep is in the doorway, and the night\nCloses behind it. The fondest lovers yawn,\nFold themselves in beds both neighbourly and right.\nA sanctuary of starlight protects them as they scan\nThe inner world of dreams, before the morning light.\nTell of the sad derangement of the man.\nTell of the sorrow before the world began.",

Mention bread\nand he wants\na slice, buttered and with honey \u2013\nimmediately. Mention the cat\nand he runs over\nto awaken her. The word\nis the thing itself. Language is simply\na necessary music\nsuddenly connected\nto the child\u2019s own heartbeat. While the young monkey child\ngrows at a different rate,\nlooks at a tree, a bush,\nat the human child\nand thinks\u2026\nWho knows what? What remains burning\nis that moment\nof staring:\nthe two newly formed heads\nbalanced on fragile necks\ntilting towards each other,\nthe monkey face\nand the human face\nabsorbing each other\nwith intense gentleness\u2026.",

What follows is the full text of the poem from which Kipling\u2019s extract deviates slightly. France Broke to every known mischance, lifted over all\nBy the light sane joy of life, the buckler of the Gaul,\nFurious in luxury, merciless in toil,\nTerrible with strength that draws from her tireless soil;\nStrictest judge of her own worth, gentlest of man\u2019s mind,\nFirst to follow Truth and last to leave old Truths behind \u2013\nFrance beloved of every soul that loves its fellow-kind! Ere our birth (rememberest thou?) side by side we lay\nFretting in the womb of Rome to begin our fray.\nEre men knew our tongues apart, our one task was known \u2013\nEach to mould the other\u2019s fate as he wrought his own.\nTo this end we stirred mankind till all Earth was ours,\nTill our world-end strifes begat wayside Thrones and Powers \u2013\nPuppets that we made or broke to bar the other\u2019s path \u2013\nNecessary, outpost-folk, hirelings of our wrath.\nTo this end we stormed the seas, tack for tack, and burst\nThrough the doorways of new worlds, doubtful which was first,\nHand on hilt (rememberest thou?) ready for the blow \u2013\nSure, whatever else we met, we should meet our foe.\nSpurred or balked at every stride by the other\u2019s strength,\nSo we rode the ages down and every ocean\u2019s length! Where did you refrain from us or we refrain from you?\nAsk the wave that has not watched war between us two?\nOthers held us for a while, but with weaker charms,\nThese we quitted at the call for each other\u2019s arms.\nEager toward the known delight, equally we strove \u2013\nEach the other\u2019s mystery, terror, need, and love.\nTo each other\u2019s open court with our proofs we came.\nWhere could we find honour else, or men to test our claim!\nFrom each other\u2019s throat we wrenched valour\u2019s last reward \u2013\nThat extorted word of praise gasped \u2018twixt lunge and guard,\nIn each other\u2019s cup we poured mingled blood and tears,\nBrutal joys, unmeasured hopes, intolerable fears \u2013\nAll that soiled or salted life for a thousand years.\nProved beyond the need of proof, matched in every clime,\nO Companion, we have lived greatly through all time! Yoked in knowledge and remorse, now we come to rest,\nLaughing at old villainies that Time has turned to jest;\nPardoning old necessities no pardon can efface \u2013\nThat undying sin we shared in Rouen market-place.\nNow we watch the new years shape, wondering if they hold\nFiercer lightnings in their heart than we launched of old.\nNow we hear new voices rise, question, boast or gird,\nAs we raged (rememberest thou?) when our crowds were stirred.\nNow we count new keels afloat, and new hosts on land,\nMassed like ours (rememberest thou?) when our strokes were planned.\nWe were schooled for dear life\u2019s sake, to know each other\u2019s blade.\nWhat can Blood and Iron make more than we have made?\nWe have learned by keenest use to know each other\u2019s mind,\nWhat shall Blood and Iron loose that we cannot bind?\nWe who swept each other\u2019s coast, sacked each other\u2019s home,\nSince the sword of Brennus clashed on the scales at Rome,\nListen, count and close again, wheeling girth to girth,\nIn the linked and steadfast guard set for peace on earth! Broke to every known mischance, lifted over all\nBy the light sane joy of life, the buckler of the Gaul;\nFurious in luxury, merciless in toil,\nTerrible with strength renewed from a tireless soil;\nStrictest judge of her own worth, gentlest of man\u2019s mind,\nFirst to face the Truth and last to leave old Truths behind \u2013\nFrance, beloved of every soul that loves or serves its kind!",

Some amateur was killing Schubert dead,\nSome of the pains the English force on me,\nSomewhere with cow-bells Austria exists,\nBut then I saw the gods pin up their lists\nBut was not on them \u2013 we live stupidly\nBut are redeemed by what cannot be said. Perhaps a language has been made which works,\nPerhaps it\u2019s tension in the cinema,\nPerhaps \u2018perhaps\u2019 is an inventive word,\nA sort of self-intending thing, a bird,\nA problem for an architect, a star,\nA plan to save Vienna from the Turks. After dinner I read myself to sleep,\nAfter which I dreamt the Eastern Front\nAfter an exchange of howitzers,\nThe Angel of Death was taking what was hers,\nThe finger missed me but the guns still grunt\nThe syntax of the real, the rules they keep. And then I woke in my own corner bed\nAnd turned away and cried into the wall\nAnd cursed the world which Mozart had to leave.\nI heard a voice which told me not to grieve,\nI heard myself. \u2018Tell them\u2019, I said to all,\n\u2018I\u2019ve had a wonderful life. I\u2019m dead.\u2019",

Love-thirty, love-forty, oh! weakness of joy,\nThe speed of a swallow, the grace of a boy,\nWith carefullest carelessness, gaily you won,\nI am weak from your loveliness, Joan Hunter Dunn. Miss Joan Hunter Dunn, Miss Joan Hunter Dunn,\nHow mad I am, sad I am, glad that you won,\nThe warm-handled racket is back in its press,\nBut my shock-headed victor, she loves me no less. Her father\u2019s euonymus shines as we walk,\nAnd swing past the summer-house, buried in talk,\nAnd cool the verandah that welcomes us in\nTo the six-o\u2019clock news and a lime-juice and gin. The scent of the conifers, sound of the bath,\nThe view from my bedroom of moss-dappled path,\nAs I struggle with double-end evening tie,\nFor we dance at the Golf Club, my victor and I. On the floor of her bedroom lie blazer and shorts,\nAnd the cream-coloured walls are be-trophied with sports,\nAnd westering, questioning settles the sun,\nOn your low-leaded window, Miss Joan Hunter Dunn. The Hillman is waiting, the light\u2019s in the hall,\nThe pictures of Egypt are bright on the wall,\nMy sweet, I am standing beside the oak stair\nAnd there on the landing\u2019s the light on your hair.

Miss Joan Hunter Dunn, Miss Joan Hunter Dunn,\nI can hear from the car park the dance has begun,\nOh! full Surrey twilight! importunate band!\nOh! strongly adorable tennis-girl\u2019s hand! Around us are Rovers and Austins afar,\nAbove us the intimate roof of the car,\nAnd here on my right is the girl of my choice,\nWith the tilt of her nose and the chime of her voice. And the scent of her wrap, and the words never said,\nAnd the ominous, ominous dancing ahead.\nWe sat in the car park till twenty to one\nAnd now I\u2019m engaged to Miss Joan Hunter Dunn.",

Not here, you\u2019re missed; now here, I need to get away,\nTo make some portion separate in the day. And not belonging here, I feel content\nWhen brooding on the portion that is spent. Where everything is strange, and yet is known,\nI sit under the trees and am alone, Until there is an emptiness all round,\nMissing your voice, the sweet habitual sound Of our own language.

  "text": "\u00a0 I have hidden something in the inner chamber\nAnd sealed the lid of the sarcophagus\nAnd levered a granite boulder against the door\nAnd the debris has covered it so perfectly\nThat though you walk over it daily you never suspect. Every day you sweat down that shaft, seeing on the walls\nThe paintings that convince you I am at home, living there.\nBut that is a blind alley, a false entrance\nFlanked by a room with a few bits of junk\nNicely displayed, conventionally chosen.\nThe throne is quaint but commonplace, the jewels inferior,\nThe decorated panels not of the best period,\nThough enough is there to satisfy curators. But the inner chamber enshrines the true essence.\nDo not be disappointed when I tell you\nYou will never find it: the authentic phoenix in gold,\nThe muslin soaked in herbs from recipes\nNo one remembers, the intricate ornaments,\nAnd above all the copious literatures inscribed\nOn ivory and papyrus, the distilled wisdom\nOf priests, physicians, poets and gods,\nEnsuring my immortality. Though even if you found them\nYou would look in vain for the key, since all are in cipher\nAnd the key is in my skull. The key is in my skull. If you found your way\nInto this chamber, you would find this last:\nMy skull. But first you would have to search the others,\nMy kinsfolk neatly parcelled, twenty-seven of them\nDisintegrating in their various ways.\nA woman from whose face the spices have pushed away\nThe delicate flaking skin: a man whose body\nSeems dipped in clotted black tar, his head detached:\nA hand broken through the cerements, protesting:\nMouths in rigid grins or soundless screams \u2013\nA catalogue of declensions. How, then, do I survive? Gagged in my winding cloths,\nThe four brown roses withered on my chest\nLeaving a purple stain, how am I different\nIn transcending these little circumstances?\nSupposing that with uncustomary skill\nYou penetrated the chamber, granite, seals,\nDragged out the treasure gloatingly, distinguished\nMy twenty-seven sorry relatives,\nLabelled them, swept and measured everything\nExcept this one sarcophagus, leaving that\nUntil the very end: supposing then\nYou lifted me out carefully under the arc-lamps\nNoting the gold fingernails, the unearthly smell\nOf preservation \u2013 would you not tremble\nAt the thought of who this might be? So you would steady\nYour hands a moment, like a man taking aim, and lift\nThe mask.\nBut this hypothesis is absurd. I have told you already\nYou will never find it. Daily you walk about\nOver the rubble, peer down the long shaft\nThat leads nowhere, make your notations, add\nAnother appendix to your laborious work.\nWhen you die, decently cremated, made proper\nBy the Registrar of Births and Deaths, given by The Times\nYour two-inch obituary, I shall perhaps\nHave a chance to talk with you. Until then, I hear\nYour footsteps over my head as I lie and think\nOf what I have hidden here, perfect and safe.",

When they\nmoved in from the Trent, the first English entered the holdings and the bodies of the people\nwho called the waters that kept them alive Tame, the Dark River, these English spread their works\nsouthward then westward, then all ways for thirty-odd miles, up to the damp tips of the thirty-odd\nweak headwaters of the Tame. By all of the Tame they settled, and sat, named themselves after it:\nTomsaetan. And back down at Tamworth, where the river almost began to amount to something,\nthe Mercian kings kept their state. Dark because there\u2019s hardly a still expanse of it\nwide enough to catch the sky, the Dark River mothered the Black Country and all but\nvanished underneath it, seeping out from the low hills by Dudley, by Upper Gornal, by Sedgley, by\nWolverhamptom, by Bloxwich, dropping morosely without a shelf or a race or a dip,\nno more than a few feet every mile, fattened a little from mean streams that join at\nTipton, Bilston, Willenhall, Darlaston, Oldbury, Wednesbury. From Bescot\nShe oozes a border round Handsworth where I was born, snakes through the flat\nmeadows that turned into Perry Barr, passes through Witton, heading for the city\nbut never getting there. A couple of miles out she catches the timeless, suspended\nscent of Nechells and Saltley\u2014coal gas, sewage, smoke\u2014turns and makes off\nfor Tamworth, caught on the right shoulder by the wash that\u2019s run under Birmingham,\na slow, petty river with no memory of an ancient name; a river called Rea, meaning river,\nand misspelt at that. Before they merge they\u2019re both steered straight, in channels\nthat force them clear of the gasworks. And the Tame gets marched out of town in the policed calm\nthat hangs under the long legs of the M6. These living rivers\nturgidly watered the fields, gave drink; drove low-powered mills, shoved\nthe Soho Works into motion, collected waste and foul waters. Gave way to steam,\ncollected sewage, factory poisons. Gave way to clean Welsh water, kept on collecting\ntyphoid. Sank out of sight under streets, highways, the black walls of workshops;\ncollected metals, chemicals, aquicides. Ceased to draw lines that weren\u2019t cancelled or unwanted; became\ndrains, with no part in anybody\u2019s plan.",

She never returned and I never saw\nHer buried. So a romance began.\nThe ivy-mother turned into a tree\nThat still hops away like a rainbow down\nThe avenue as I approach.\nMy tendrils are the ones that clutch. I made a life for her over the years.\nFrustrated no more by a dull marriage\nShe ran a canteen through several wars.\nThe wit of a cliche-ridden village\nShe met her match at an extra-mural\nClass and the OU summer school. Many a hero in his time\nAnd every poet has acquired\nA lost woman to haunt the home,\nTo be compensated and desired,\nWho will not alter, who will not grow,\nA corpse they need never get to know. She is nearly always benign. Her habit\nIs not to stride at dead of night.\nSoft and crepuscular in rabbit-\nLight she comes out. Hear how they hate\nThemselves for losing her as they did.\nHer country is bland and she does not chide. But my lost woman evermore snaps\nFrom somewhere else: \u2018You did not love me.\nI sacrificed too much perhaps,\nI showed you the way to rise above me\nAnd you took it. You are the ghost\nWith the bat-voice, my dear. I am not lost.\u2019",

The garden could have been\nMiles away. We were taken down to the green\nAsparagus beds, the cut lawn, and the smell of it\nComes each summer after rain when white returns. Our bird,\nA canary called Peter, sang behind bars. The black and white cat\nCurled and snoozed by the fire and danger was far away. Far away for us. Safety was life and only now do I know\nThat white walls and lit leaves knocking windows\nAre a good prison but always you have\nTo escape, fly off from love not felt as love,\nBut our bird died in his yellow feathers. The quick\nCat caught him, tore him through bars when we were out\nAnd I do not remember tears or sadness, I only\nRemember the ritual, the warm yellow feathers we put\nIn a cardboard egg. What a sense of fitness. How far, I know now,\nRitual goes back, egg to egg, birth to burial and we went\nDown the garden softly, two in a small procession,\nAnd the high clouds bent down, the sky pulled aside\nIts blue curtains. Death was there or else\nWhere the wise cat had hidden. That day we buried our bird\nWith a sense of fitness, not knowing death would be hard\nLater, dark, without form or purpose.\nAfter my first true grief I wept, was sad, was dark, but today,\nClear of terror and agony,\nThe yellow bird sings in my mind and I say\nThat the child is callous but wise, knows the purpose of play.\nAnd the grief of ten years ago\nNow has an ancient rite,\nA walk down the garden carrying death in an egg\nAnd the sky singing, the trees still waving farewell\nWhen dying was nothing to know.",

The argument was conducted in civilized terms,\nBut we stood in the street, there were distractions, In spite of which we both felt for the crux:\nDoes a dog have a will capable of the Good?

Who cared if it jumped into the water?\nWho cared if it collared a floundering child? And under the brooding lurked, not yet material,\nA poem scheming to coax into focus a local image \u2013 Ten dinghies fluttering tiny peppermint sails,\nEach dinghy a nest with two children in it, Strung out on a cord behind the rubber mother boat,\nAll the children laughing, waving, and feeling free, The bursts of song from the children\u2019s throats,\nAnd before them, gold against an oceanic blue, The figurehead dog, ears pinned back by the wind,\nHis attention to it all, and a great joy in his jowls. Even then, the scene: and the poem would pivot\nOn breathlessness, a moment of suspense. How, it would say, as the procession of dinghies\nHeaded away from the coast and out to sea, Either their voices had passed out of earshot,\nOr else the children were learning fear. The silence now as they skim over the water.\nThe blue of a ravening deep underneath them.",

A Captain\nAt most, then a Baker by the name\nOf Smart-Ass; it was written\nBold in sepia on the wall of the vault.\nNameless lovers, they captured interest, Because the artist had painted a musical\nInstrument only. For animals a dish\nOf water and a rib with meat on it\nWere sufficient; children had their names\nAnd dolls, quaint, with amiable features. * Now it is difficult. The graves go down\nDeeper. The dead are tangled in a heap,\nScooped up and in and left to rot.\nWaves of them come up with a stink,\nAgony in the gaping rhomboid mouths, Some with bedroom slippers on their feet.\nSo many, how to identify them? How\nInsert into such a moist dissolution\nThe fizz of feeling what they felt?\nHow hard the spade treats their pit, For the antique mass graves were no prettier;\nBelow bright multitudes there was only earth.\nHerded by radio signals, decrepit codes,\nAnd closing now the hoop, above the business,\nKillers converge, dull as the dirt itself. * I dig and dig; still no rockbottom. Up\nThrough layers goes the life: the damned (select,\nGraded along the lines of a belief system);\nThe purged; then the beautiful, sublime \u2013 ?\nA breath rotates the stars? Up my street The ordinary, the losers, and police patrols\nPull back, then squinny as through chinks\nIn a forest: there still might be a glade,\nFilthy with condoms and broken bottles,\nWhere someone hangs out, punctured, with a cry Claiming he\u2019s been abandoned. Who,\nWho but a fool would lend him a hand?\nHe\u2019s a statistic, we have jiggered our symbols,\nAnd blink unawed at the galaxy. The one wand\nDeploys vacantly its many magic darts. * Love one another, they said, as if a say-so\nOn Dover Beach, or in Manhattan, shamed the cruel,\nAs if it purged away the myth or purging. Words that taunt waken only the bad blood. I should return with my spade to simple tombs.",

Bands played.\nThat was fine. But what I liked best\nwas the last shot of the completed sea,\nfilling the screen, then the saw-lines disappeared,\ntill almost imperceptibly the surface moved\nand it was again the real Atlantic, glad\nto distraction to be released, raised\nabove itself in growing gusts, allowed\nto roar as rain drove down and darkened,\nallowed to blot, for a moment, the orderer\u2019s hand.",

  "text": "The beetle runs into the future. He takes\nto his heels in an action so frantic its\nflicker seems to possess the slowness of deep\nwater. He has been green. He will be so yet.\nHis memory ripples emeralds. The wasp\ntakes it easy. She unpicks her fabric of\nyellow and black, which slips from her fingers to\nland in the past, loop-holed, lacy, tossed off on\nthe wing. The beetle is needled right through on\none string. He peels a strip as he packs a shelf.\nHe is thrilling the grass, and whatever it\nmeans, it is radiantly green like himself Thus\nhe will invest again and again in that\nsame flashy suit. The wasp has forgotten her\ncostume, but proves herself wise to the ways of\nthe sun, which are pat on her back. She drops a\ncurtsy, blows a kiss, and somersaults over\nthe beetle\u2019s attack. Lost moments swill round in\nthe shallows, until they can stick there and stack. The beetle swears it\u2019s a set-up job. Follow\nyour mouth. Swallow tomorrow. Borrow and bet.\nRivet your eyes on the road, and do what you\nsaid. You run through the beetles you have been, and\ninsist there are more of the same up ahead.\nThe wasp says goodbye to those she has never\nmet. She swirls down to just touch the track, so that\nshe definitely indicates her shadow,\na generous fellow, who has come on his\nown, to join in. He\u2019s an item. And now he\u2019s\nclose kin. She gives him a hug. Then that\u2019s her in\nmid-air and she\u2019s left him. He\u2019s a scoundrel, who\ndodges about and grows dim. Neglected. The\nnecklace has snapped. Scramble for beads. Some of them\nstill roll and sparkle, prickling the gorse and the\nstamens of the bittersweet. This will be the\nbest place for muttering nonsense. We could meet\nanywhere in the wood. Tired in the hawthorn\nbrake. Tricked by the thick vegetation. Gutted. A snatch at the clasp and a curse as our prayers\nscatter. One of them comes to a stop by a\ndazzling white stone. Others tag darker places.\nSo be it. Snipe lie near small pools, to hide in\ntheir glare. Purple orchids are smuts in the dusk..\nA wasp is humming as it investigates\nthe gravelly foreground, where no gods squat, but\nsomeone pictured an overturned goblet. The\nstub of a tree with a kingfisher on it.\nCybele carefully holds up a quince. Now\nspecialist theatres are opening all\nalong the hedge. Sparrows adopt passionate\nposes in each of them. Detail is so sharp\nand so minute that the total form suggests\ninfinity. Everything. Wincing. Oh, but\nthereby, it seems to me, there is infinite\nloneliness. Such tons of shingle. If I find\nmy feet in it, I will walk up and down and\nsing, that they shall hear that I am not afraid. The beetle straightens his jacket to confirm\nan initial conception. After all there\nare not many cores. The car doors slam behind\nhis shoulders and he pulls away into the\nbest, fast synthesis that there is, blazing down\nthe mid-line, the Roman Street, his heart in his\nhorn. The wasps and moths and feathers are riff-raff\noff the verge. Stuff for his buffet. And isn\u2019t\nIsis Demeter? No mysteries in here,\nIt\u2019s me, hands on the wheel, and capable of\nbrilliant wristy brushwork, if I rouse out\nmy conceit across the blur of foliage.\nBut. Who knows what monsters were revered by the\nEgyptians? We must not boast or palter. Don\u2019t\nrush the sense, or stagger if it\u2019s true. Ask me\nnot what. The duke has dined. Three layers of the\nlapis, mixed with white lead. The last translucent\nglaze, and no golden scumble. Cool and intense.\nGuaranteed to be the bluest of the blue.",

It is a hybrid creature with only\nThree legs and a faint ephemeral grin, With feminine curves, a gorgeous womanly\nVoluptuousness. It seems almost indecent\nTo be sitting beneath her, guilty and lonely, Ignorant of the role she will play. The cresent\nOf her one hip is a shelter and the gloss\nOf her body temptation. Concupiscent Discords swell into proper fifths, zealous\nArpeggios clamber over her. Learning\nHer vast bourgeois temperament is the cross A child must bear as she stands burning\nIn the summer sun. And Chopin and Bartok\nCan be enticed from her with their strut and yearning. You must woo her carefully with wealth and work,\nUntil one day, like the butterfly she is,\nShe shrugs and vanishes into the sudden dark Of history and other shady business.",

When delusions of communication cease\nAnd we are victims once again\nOf rumours the gossip wind is bringing\nWe\u2019ll celebrate the singers in their peace\nBecause above the graves of men\nThe happy grass is singing.",

  "text": "\u00a0 Every year when the extreme cold\nFalls suddenly over us, cracking the skin\nStraightaway, that has been oiled by summer,\nFreezing to a standstill the heart, strangling movement,\nI hear the same awful story, in different versions. I had begun to think it was the myth-making faculty\nLike the wartime story that a man in Australia\nAnd a man in Finland\nHeard from his father:\nThe limb blown off that landed in his dinner\nIn the exact same way; and only some detail revealed\n(A sock in one version, in another a hand with a mitten\nIn one a lamb chop, in another a plate of porridge)\nThat this was a variant of archetypal legend\nAnd brought relief and laughter that it wasn\u2019t real. An idiot brother chained to the bed for years;\nThe drunken return only to punch up the wife,\nEvery year pregnant, and to get her pay-packet;\nDog on cushions and relative in a boxroom\nKept on biscuits.\nPunch hitting Judy over the head with a stick. Gruesome stories\nArising, miasma from marshes, from the foetid pools\nThat stand in the human mind. Alas not so, alas I am forced to listen:\nThey found a child of eight dead in a bath.\nIt had been a night, the coldest over Christmas\nWhen \u2013 heating in the house, good dinner inside me\nWoolly scarf round my feet, five blankets, thick mattress\nEiderdown, bottle \u2013 I had felt too freezing\nTo put out my arm from underneath the bedclothes\nThe air inside the house had such a bite. The child had nothing on, there was no towel\nNo flannel he could clutch or put against him.\nThe window had been wedged open and the door locked.\nThe snow-laden wind cut through the curtainless room\nKeeping the enamel five degrees below freezing. The child was frozen blue in the empty white bath\nHis urine an iced runnel. It was Christmas Eve when his parents locked him in. This year I hear that last night there in Poland\nIt was 37 degrees below and men\nTaken across the snow-stormed plain, were made\nTo stand outside the wagons in the dark\nAnd hosed down with water that instantly froze on them\nAnd left till dawn, standing in ice-bound Europe. Who are these people? The woman I see in the grocer\u2019s\nPolite to customers. The couple who, arm in arm\nEvery Saturday morning go to the Post Office.\nNumbed, as with cold, all I do is mouth\nIn a silent howl, like the paralysing frost,\n\u2018How long ? How long?\u2019 Another year; a summer has intervened,\nA healthy fat baby next door is leaping about.\nA little chill breath of autumn creeps through the dusk.\nI close the back door, think about lighting fires.\nTired, a bit cold, I think of an early night:\nSome warm food, a bath and a soft clean blanket \u2013 and sleep. In my hot bath lies drowned the ice-dead child.",

They seem to lean\nAgainst the raking wind as they begin\nTheir slow advance; at every pace they pause\nAnd plunge into earth before their toes\nTheir sharpened sticks; then each of them withdraws\nHis pointed probe and lifts it to his nose.\nWe know that they are sniffing for a trace\nOf carrion from the scabbard of the ground,\nAnd somewhere in that God-forsaken place\nThe murdered children lie and must be found. Not on the screen but being watched by it\nThe man and woman move about the room,\nLift ornaments and put them down, then sit,\nThough only briefly, in the curtained gloom,\nUntil they rise again and climb the stairs\nAnd prowl around the house. They do not speak\nAnd neither sees the pain the other bears,\nNor understands that what they both now seek,\nIn dazed, somnambulistic wandering\nFrom room to room, will never be revealed:\nForgiveness, that intolerable thing,\nWhich all their guilt and suffering will not yield.",

Seeping through streets this gleam feeds you. Day by day you calcify, embalming\nThe vigour you exhale. Fragile you have\nSubdued the molten mornings in your calyx\nThe palpitating golden fire that poured\nOver the ridges of buildings, right angles, volutes;\nAnd converted percussion of day to this calm strong flowing\nLight lapping gentle round the afternoon;\nWill equally subdue the night to come \u2013\nA ray shooting the dark \u2013 into a mere\nClosure of a known twilight, not different state. O rose in the afternoon, your only movement\nThe imperceptible falling in your blood,\nYour vibrant stillness more speaking than all the voices,\nIf I could give you as answer, my sentence your statement\nI would be dumb in peace with the light gone\nAnd only your image waking in the dark.",

We\u2019re on the very brink\nOf what? Can any prophet, true or false,\nMake himself heard above the mad uproar\nOf all the mingling and ambiguous,\nSelf-righteous or dismayed denunciations,\nWarnings and dire predictions that assail us from\nAll \u2018informed sources\u2019 media-debased and bent? \u2013 If this is a poem, where are the images?\n\u2013 What images suffice?

Think truth beautiful?\n\u2013 \u2018A terrible beauty is born\u2026\u2019 \u2013 It is indeed.

And yet I yearn to end by trying to evoke\nA summer dawn I saw when I was not yet eight,\nAnd having risen early watched for an hour or more\nA transcendental transformation of auroral clouds,\nLike a prophetic vision granted from on high.\nI cannot see much now. The dawn is always new\nAs nature is, however much we blind ourselves and try\nTo poison the Earth-Mother. But an ancient text\nTells of what I believe may happen soon today:\nThe raven disappears as night draws to its close,\nThen as the day approaches the bird flies without wings;\nIt vomits forth the rainbow and its body becomes red,\nAnd on its back a condensation of pure water forms.\nFor that which is above is still as that which is below\nFor the perfecting of the One Thing, which is now\nAs it shall ever be, World without End, D.V.",

  "text": "\u00a0 We built a palace for them, made of bedrooms.\nWe even tracked down playmates for them\n(No easy job since prostitutes went out\nWhen self-rule came). We dug a pool,\nConstructed shops, and a hut for movies\nWith benches outside for the girls to wait on.\nSerene House was what we called it.\nWe did our bit in that war. Air America brought them from the battlefield.\nWe lifted the girls from the suburbs by buses:\nChinese, Indian, Malay, Eurasian,\nHealthy and well-fed and full of play. There were cameras in plenty, tape-recorders\nAnd binoculars for the soldiers to buy\nFor the girls; for the girls to sell back\nTo the shops; for the shops to sell to the soldiers. Serene House was near the varsity. The GIs\nStrayed across the campus with Nikons and blank faces:\nIt was feared they might assault the female students.\nThey seemed scared of their own cameras.\nThey looked at nobody; nobody looked at them.\nThat violence down the road \u2013\nIt was good for business, and we did our bit.\nOtherwise it was a vulgar subject. Once I found a GI in the corridor,\nYoung and dazed, gazing at the notice-boards.\nThe Misses Menon, Lee, Fernandez, Poh and Noor\nShould report for a tutorial at 3 p.m.\nBringing their copies of The Revenger\u2019s Tragedy \u2026\nIf Mr Sharma fails to pass his essay up this week\nHe will find himself in serious trouble\u2026\nThe Literary Society seeks help in cutting sandwiches \u2026 He was still there thirty minutes later,\nA stunned calf. I asked if I could help.\nHe shrank away: \u2018It is not allowed to stand here?\u2019\nThe corridor was dingy, walls streaked with bat shit,\nsomewhere a typewriter clacked like small arms.\n\u2018Is there \u2026 would there be a \u2026 library?\u2019\nOne of the best in fact in South-east Asia. \u2013\nI offered to show him. He trembled\nwith a furtive pleasure. His only licence\nWas to kill, to copulate and purchase cameras. What sort of books would he like to see?\nOutside in the quad he was jumpy,\nAs if unused to the open. He glanced behind,\nThen whispered. Yes, there was something \u2026\nDid I think \u2026 What could he be after? The Natural History\nof the Poontang, with Plates, by some defrocked\nMedico called Aristotle? How to Get to Sweden\nBy Kon-Tiki through the Indian Ocean? \u2018Would they have anything \u2026\u2019 A quick look\nRound \u2013 \u2018 \u2026 by Cardinal Newman, do you think?\u2019\nI left him in the stacks, the Apologia in his hands,\nHe didn\u2019t notice when I went away. Inside Serene House, in the meantime,\nGirls galore (such lengths we went to!)\nLolled on the benches, played with binoculars,\nClicked their empty cameras, and groused.\nThe soldiers were happy to quit Vietnam;\nFive days with us, and they were glad to go back,\nRest and recreation, they said, was too much for them.\nWe weren\u2019t surprised when the Americans didn\u2019t win.",

Imagine in space-time irretrievable mothers viewingthe pensioners their babies have become.\u201cWell, that\u2019s life, nothing we can do about it now.\u201dThey don\u2019t love us as much as they did, andwhy should they?

Who made this mess,this developer\u2019s sprawl of roads that can\u2019t be retaken,high tension wires that run dangerously under the skin?What is it the sceptical eyes are saying to the twisted lips:ambition is a clich?, beauty a banality? In any case,this face has given them up \u2013 old friends whose obituariesit reads in the mirror with scarcely a regret. So, who\u2019s joking with the photographer?And what did she think she was doing,taking pictures of the impossible? Was a radioscopeattached to her lens? Something teasing under the skullhas infiltrated the surface, something you can\u2019t seeuntil you look away, then it shoots out and tickles you.You could call it soul or spirit, but that would be serious.Look for a word that mixes affection with insurrection,frivolity, child\u2019s play, rude curiosity,a willingness to lift the seventh veil and welcome Yorick.That\u2019s partly what the photo says. The rest is private,guilt that rouses memory at four in the morning,truths such as Hamlet used, torturing his mother,all the dark halftones of the sensuous unsayablefinding a whole woman there, in her one face.",

  "text": "\u00a0 In a real city, from a real house,\nAt midnight by the ticking clocks,\nIn winter by the crackling roads:\nHearing the noodle-vendor\u2019s flute,\nTwo single fragile falling notes\u2026\nBut what can this small sing-song say,\nUnder the noise of war?\nThe flute itself a counterfeit\n(Siberian wind can freeze the lips),\nMerely a rubber bulb and metal horn\n(Hard to ride a cycle, watch for manholes\nAnd late drunks, and play a flute together).\nJust squeeze between gloved fingers,\nAnd the note of mild hope sounds:\nRelease, the indrawn sigh of mild despair\u2026\nA poignant signal, like the cooee\nOf some diffident soul locked out,\nLess than appropriate to cooling macaroni.\nTwo wooden boxes slung across the wheel,\nA rider in his middle age, trundling\nThis gross contraption on a dismal road,\nRed eyes and nose and breathless rubber horn.\nYet still the pathos of that double tune\nDefies its provenance, and can warm\nThe bitter night.\nSleepless, we turn and sleep.\nOr sickness dwindles to some local limb.\nBought love for one long moment gives itself.\nOr there a witch assures a frightened child\nShe bears no personal grudge.\nAnd I, like other listeners,\nSee my stupid sadness as a common thing.\nAnd being common,\nTherefore something rare indeed.\nThe puffing vendor, surer than a trumpet,\nTells us we are not alone.\nEach night that same frail midnight tune\nSqueezed from a bogus flute,\nUnder the noise of war, after war\u2019s noise,\nIt mourns the fallen, every night\nIt celebrates survival \u2013\nIn real cities, real houses, real time.",

  "text": "\u00a0 Africa in America. Catch a goat.\nTake a sharp blade, rub it against stone.\nBrace the goat and yourself and cut its throat.\nDrain the blood into calabash, ignore the moan\nof ropy liquid against the gourd; throw\nsand on the spot to prevent dogs homing\nin on that coagulating blood. Skin the carcass.\nStretch the skin over wood for one purpose. It stinks and dries in an indirect sun.\nThe meat is ready for a pot, dying to be cured,\nparcelled out to family and friends, the horns\nground into powder then mixed into a puree\nwith herbs, the feet for a broth (the scrotum\nis a delicacy), the tongue peppered\nfor stew, the tail continues to whisk flies,\nthe hooves walk mountainous clouds in the sky. Skin over wood. Hollow wood.\nStretched skin. Hands talk to heart.\nBoneless hands. Thinking heart. A flood\nof understanding comes to that part\nof the wood beneath that skin about the good\nimbued by hands coming down smart\non it, fluid fingers flowing above the skin,\nflattering it with touch-talk, and it sings. A continent in sound. Sound brings\na continent across the sky and sea.\nA continent shaped by hands on skin\nsacrificed by a goat who must have seen\nhis soul fluting, not on a heady mountain\nledge, but airborne, dragging this parachute free\nof its moorings, relocating an archipelago\nin sounds of souls no longer cargo. Until goat talked it down to the ground,\ncoaxed it up through the soles of our feet\ninto our chest and our head and our tongue.\nIt is a lost, forgotten place, missing teeth\nworried by our tongue, something we long\nfor, dream of, but won\u2019t know if we meet.\nThe Africa we never got to know\nsprung in the America we reap and sow. Our heads spin with this posited place.\nOur skulls resonate with our captured past.\nIt weighs our hearts, brimming all the spaces\nbetween with all the things we feel we\u2019ve lost.\nOur flesh aches and only pains less when faced\nwith drum talk; drum bringing down the ghost\nof Africa from dreams, down through history,\nand up up up through flesh and blood stories. When Tom first hears about Africa\nhe thinks slaves have circumvented their hurt\nwith their version of a heaven freer\nthan paradise because right here on earth,\nuntil he listens to the drum concertina,\na continent into two hands, two hands worth\na continent; and if those hands are driven\nby a body and soul then their art is heaven. But the sea, the unassailable see,\nwhere Time drowned and Africa floated,\nboth lost to slaves, both in water\u2019s company,\nleaves Tom feeling there\u2019s a fishbone in his throat,\nthat Africa had never been, would never be\nmore than something stirred by the goat-\nskin drum, a waking dream that lasts\nonly as long as the song of the drum blasts. He fancies every flock heading for a trap,\ntheir chevrons marking a winding road in air\nerased by the sea, a road not on any map,\nexcept that each heartbeat sends a chevron flair\nradiating through his body, sketching this gap:\nhis head that is Africa tapers into a cadaver\nthat\u2019s the sea; the rise and fall of his body,\na current in his veins; his neck is an estuary. If he listens to the drum with flesh and bone,\nand his African head, he finds his way back\nto Africa through movement and tone.\nThe time he lost is measured out on the track\nof his spine that buckles, curves, snaps, hones\nitself to time and Africa and the ship\u2019s deck\nof the sea, now over him, shuffling its boards,\nnow under him, like a spine without a cord. The sea holds still long enough for him to draw\na map. Air stirs without disturbing the markers\narranged by a migratory flock. Clouds crawl\nacross the tinged canvas stretched over-\nhead, a cartographer\u2019s dream, all raw\nin unbounded love of gradients and contours.\nNight lights up the compass points that Tom\nnavigates by; the drum is his metronome. His body twitches in recognition of the rhythm\nof ship on sea and wind in sails; no land\nin sight; not a hint of vegetation in the hymn\nof that wind, nor in the reflection of sky and\nsea in each other\u2019s mirror held up for him\nin a choreography Tom understands\nfully but every time deliberately forgets\njust to experience more deeply the next. Stella lifts her dress above her knees\nto free her legs for little kicks, stamps\nand flicks of heel, instep and balls of feet.\nShe shakes bits of Africa from the damp\nAmerican soil that when dry frees\nso much dust an African edifice jams\nagainst the sky and Stella climbs its ladder\nback through time to her ancestors. [\u2026] Tom takes his cup with honey. Stella drinks\nhers straight. It\u2019s the tea of penury.\nThe tea of repentance. The tea of thanks\nfor surviving the nightmares to see\ndawn, well, yes, dawn. For a time that stinks,\na time to forget, regret, this is the tea.\nDrink it and maybe all your troubles\nbrewed and stewed in one cup can be gobbled. She wakes with a dry mouth and sleepy\nfrom her fitful slumber. That cup at that time \u2013\nfor all its historical baggage \u2013 is the remedy.\nThe heat, the wet, the caffeine, the taste, combine\n(no, stronger) conspire, each day to ready\nher to face a life she\u2019s more inclined\nto skip, if she had the choice: suicide\nis no option, life is for living, she decides.",

After a hot summer, fields grow talkative.\nWheat speaks in crop marks, grasses in parch marks. Wheat or grass, what they tell is the truth\nOf things that lay underneath five thousand years ago, The forts, the barrows, the barns, the shrines, the walls.\nThese are the native ghosts. After a hot summer. No haunting. No rattle of chains. They just lie there\nIn their rigid truthfulness, the ghosts of things. Part iv We carry our human ghosts around with us.\nAs we grow we face the mirrors, and see The spectre of a great-aunt, a vague look\nKnown only from sepia snapshots. The hands we\u2019re used to \u2013 Yes, these \u2013 their contours came by way of a long retinue\nOf dust. We are photofits of the past, And the future eyes us sideways as we eye ourselves.\nWe are the ghosts of great-aunts and grand-nephews. We are ghosts of what is dead and not yet born. Part vi Ghosts of past, present, future.\nBut the ones the living would like to meet are the echoes\nOf moments of small dead joys still quick in the streets, Voices calling I\u2019ve passed / We won / QED /\nIt didn\u2019t hurt much, Mum / They\u2019ve given me the job /\nI have decided to name this apple Bramley; And the women convicts singing their Holloway march,\nWhile Ethel Smyth conducts from her cell with a toothbrush. Part vii These are the ghosts the living would prefer,\nGhosts who\u2019d improve our ratings. Ghosts\nOf the great innocent songs of freedom\nThat shoulder their way round the world like humpback whales, Ghosts of the singers, the dancers, the liberated,\nHolding hands and cheering in parks, while the tanks\nSquat immobilized. Ghosts of the women on the fish quay\nHugging each other when at last the boats come in. Ghosts of the last night of the Proms. And ghosts of lovers,\nWandering round London, so happy that they could\nHave danced danced danced all night.",

When we told the garden-boy\nHow we saw the phantom glide,\nWith a grin his face was bright\nAs the pool he stood beside. \u2018That\u2019s no ghost-walk,\u2019 Billy said,\n\u2018Nor a ghost you fear to stop \u2013\nOnly old Miss Wickerby\nOn a short cut to the shop.\u2019 So next day we lay in wait,\nPassed a civil time of day,\nSaid how pleased we were she came\nDaily down our garden-way. Suddenly her cheek it paled,\nTurned, as quick, from ice to flame.\n\u2018Tell me,\u2019 said Miss Wickerby\n\u2018Who spoke of me, and my name?\u2019 \u2018Bill the garden-boy,\u2019\nShe sighed,\nSaid, \u2018Of course, you could not know\nHow he drowned \u2013 that very pool \u2013\nA frozen winter \u2013 long ago.\u2019",

Johnston stood beside the barrel.\nAll day he stood there.\nHe woke in a ditch, his mouth full of ashes. Grieve bought a balloon and a goldfish.\nHe swung through the air.\nHe fired shotguns, rolled pennies, ate sweet fog from a stick. Heddle was at the Market also.\nI know nothing of his activities.\nHe is and always was a quiet man. Garson went three rounds with a negro boxer,\nAnd received thirty shillings\nMuch applause, and an eye loaded with thunder. Where did they find Flett?\nThey found him in a brazen circle,\nAll flame and blood, a new Salvationist. A gypsy saw in the hand of Halcro\nGreat strolling herds, harvests, a proud woman.\nHe wintered in the poorhouse. They drove home from the Market under the stars\nExcept for Johnston\nWho lay in a ditch, his mouth full of dying fires.",

But customers\nAre a problem, or watching them is; one of\nHer big responsibilities the moment\nShe enters. Being a customer herself\nDoes not feel natural any more, you go\nTo other shops, and watch; or wonder who\nIs customer and who Security.\nSome of the staff are Security as well.\nBeverley has a dream that, except for her,\nAll customers and staff are Security.",

That was because it rained all the time very hard\nwhere we lived as children,\nIn the house with the nineteen rooms of forbidden books\n(To test how we could conquer the thirst to read)\nAnd a few permitted books in the sitting rooms,\nBut Nanny in a book-lined room we might never enter,\nIn a turret above the lawn where the croquet hoops\nWere feet deep in water for very much of the time. But Courage, said Nanny, wellingtons on,\nBacks up, chins up, and best foot forward\nIn a long line, holding tightly on to each other\n\u2013 Out! So the small but courageous band of us\nPaddled hand-in-hand onwards,\nNanny first, me second,\nThen the third and fourth, diminishing in size\nTo the very smallest who came infallibly last,\nHead just above water. And as we sadly struggled, the small cold hand\nOf my youngest brother\nSlipped out of the grasp of the one next above him in age.\nAnd when that next one tired, her hand\nReleased the fingers of the sibling senior to her,\nAnd the line fell gradually apart,\nLeaving me\nWaving frantically after Nanny, who was far ahead\nAnd had almost disappeared. But Courage! The call of Nanny rang distantly over\nThe widening waters in the dark,\nAnd returned in echoes from the other shore.\nThe waterfowl answered in imitation and unison\nTo comfort each other And Nanny\u2019s cry merged into theirs,\nGrowing fainter and fainter in the rain until\nIt became at last an everyday sound you hear\nAnd think little about for very much of the time.",

Hard on noon four bearded merchants\nPast the pipe-spitting pier-head strolled,\nHoly with greed, chanting\nTheir slow grave jargon. A tinker keened like a tartan gull\nAt cuithe-hung doors. A crofter lass\nTrudged through the lavish dung\nIn a dream of corn-stalks and milk. In the Arctic Whaler three blue elbows fell,\nRegular as waves, from beards spumy with porter,\nTill the amber day ebbed out\nTo its black dregs. The boats drove furrows homeward, like ploughmen\nIn blizzards of gulls. Gaelic fisher girls\nFlashed knife and dirge\nOver drifts of herring, And boys with penny wands lured gleams\nFrom the tangled veins of the flood. Houses went blind\nUp one steep close, for a\nGrief by the shrouded nets. The kirk, in a gale of psalms, went heaving through\nA tumult of roofs, freighted for heaven. And lovers\nUnblessed by steeples lay under\nThe buttered bannock of the moon. He quenched his lantern, leaving the last door.\nBecause of his gay poverty that kept\nMy seapink innocence\nFrom the worm and black wind; And because, under equality\u2019s sun,\nAll things wear now to a common soiling,\nIn the fire of images\nGladly I put my hand\nTo save that day for him.",

It was their moment.\nTwenty million bats fly out of an astonishingly low culvert\nevery night, in season. I kid you not. After a cursory swoop\nor two, they all fly back in. It all happens in a matter of\nminutes, seconds, almost. Which reminds me, have you chosen your second?\nMephisto wants you to use this foil. It works better.\nNo, there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. Hours later I stood with the good doctor\nin a snow-encrusted orchard. He urged the value\nof mustard plasters on me. \u201cSee, it makes sense.\u201d\nYet we both knew they are poisonous in some climates,\nthough only if taken in minute quantities.

There is so much to be\nseen everywhere that it\u2019s like not getting used to it, only there is so much it\nnever feels new, never any different. You are standing looking at that\nbuilding and you cannot take it all in, certain details are already hazy and\nthe mind boggles. What will it all be like in five years\u2019 time when you try\nto remember? Will there have been boards in between the grass part and\nthe edge of the street? As long as that couple is stopping to look in that\nwindow over there we cannot go. We feel like they have to tell us we can,\nbut they never look our way and they are already gone, gone far into the\nfuture \u2013 the night of time. If we could look at a photograph of it and say\nthere they are, they never really stopped but there they are. There is so\nmuch to be said, and on the surface of it very little gets said.\nThere ought to be room for more things, for a spreading out, like.

Not even offer to pay.\nIt is possible that finally, like coming to the end of a long, barely\nperceptible rise, there is mutual cohesion and interaction. The whole scene\nis fixed in your mind, the music all present, as though you could see each\nnote as well as hear it. I say this because there is an uneasiness in things\njust now. Waiting for something to be over before you are forced to notice\nit. The pollarded trees scarely bucking the wind \u2013 and yet it\u2019s keen, it\nmakes you fall over. Clabbered sky. Seasons that pass with a rush. After all\nit\u2019s their time too \u2013 nothing says they aren\u2019t to make something of it.

But the others \u2013 and they in some way must know too \u2013 it\nwould never occur to them to want to, even if they could take the first step\nof the terrible journey toward feeling somebody should act, that ends in\nutter confusion and hopelessness, east of the sun and west of the moon.

And how would I wish to go?\nNot as in opera \u2013 that would offend \u2013\nnor like a blue-eyed cowboy shot and short of words,\nbut finger-tapping still our private morse,\u2019\u2026love you,\u2019\nbefore the last flowers and flies descend.",

Not now, so still.\nThey are, are, are, are, are the things I see\nAnd will be when they\u2019re lost, obliterated,\nThe model passed away.\nOn this old empty vase glazed patterns dance,\nAbove it fixed wings beat, the migrants\u2019 flight Good morning, present, absent ones, good night.",

What do you think of me?\nI have a rough coat like Africa.\nI am crafty with dark spots\nlike the bush-tufted plains of Africa. I sprawl as a shaggy bundle of gathered energy\nlike Africa sprawling in its waters.\nI trot, I lope, I slaver, I am a ranger.\nI hunch my shoulders. I eat the dead. Do you like my song?\nWhen the moon pours hard and cold on the veldt\nI sing, and I am the slave of darkness.\nOver the stone walls and the mud walls and the ruined places\nand the owls, the moonlight falls.\nI sniff a broken drum. I bristle. My pelt is silver.\nI howl my song to the moon \u2013 up it goes.\nWould you meet me there in the waste places? It is said I am a good match\nfor a dead lion. I put my muzzle\nat his golden flanks, and tear. He\nis my golden supper, but my tastes are easy.\nI have a crowd of fangs, and I use them.\nOh and my tongue \u2013 do you like me\nwhen it comes lolling out over my jaw\nvery long, and I am laughing?\nI am not laughing.\nBut I am not snarling either, only\npanting in the sun, showing you\nwhat I grip\ncarrion with. I am waiting\nfor the foot to slide,\nfor the heart to seize\nfor the leaping sinews to go slack,\nfor the fight to the death to be fought to the death,\nfor a glazing eye and the rumour of blood.\nI am crouching in my dry shadows\ntill you are ready for me.\nMy place is to pick you clean\nand leave your bones to the wind.",

[Other voices]\nBravo, bravo, bravo.\nHip, hip, hooray.\nHip, hip, hooray.\nHip, hip, hooray.\nBravo. This is the full text of the poem Browning was struggling to remember: How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris, and he;\nI gallop\u2019d, Dirck gallop\u2019d, we gallop\u2019d all three;\n\u201cGood speed!\u201d cried the watch, as the gate-bolts undrew;\n\u201cSpeed!\u201d echoed the wall to us galloping through;\nBehind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,\nAnd into the midnight we gallop\u2019d abreast. Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace\nNeck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;\nI turn\u2019d in my saddle and made its girths tight,\nThen shorten\u2019d each stirrup, and set the pique right,\nRebuckled the cheek-strap, chain\u2019d slacker the bit,\nNor gallop\u2019d less steadily Roland a whit. \u2018Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near\nLokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawn\u2019d clear;\nAt Boom, a great yellow star came out to see;\nAt D?ffeld, \u2019twas morning as plain as could be;\nAnd from Mechelm church-steeple we heard the half chime,\nSo, Joris broke silence with, \u201cYet there is time!\u201d At Aershot, up leap\u2019d of a sudden the sun,\nAnd against him the cattle stood black every one,\nTo stare thro\u2019 the mist at us galloping past,\nAnd I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,\nWith resolute shoulders, each butting away\nThe haze, as some bluff river headland its spray: And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back\nFor my voice, and the other prick\u2019d out on his track;\nAnd one eye\u2019s black intelligence, \u2013 ever that glance\nO\u2019er its white edge at me, his own master, askance!\nAnd the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon\nHis fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on. By Hasselt, Dirck groan\u2019d; and cried Joris \u201cStay spur!\nYour Roos gallop\u2019d bravely, the fault\u2019s not in her,\nWe\u2019ll remember at Aix\u201d \u2013 for one heard the quick wheeze\nOf her chest, saw the stretch\u2019d neck and staggering knees,\nAnd sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,\nAs down on her haunches she shudder\u2019d and sank. So, we were left galloping, Joris and I,\nPast Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;\nThe broad sun above laugh\u2019d a pitiless laugh,\n\u2018Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;\nTill over by Dalhem a dome-spire sprang white,\nAnd \u201cGallop,\u201d gasped Joris, \u201cfor Aix is in sight! \u201cHow they\u2019ll greet us!\u201d \u2013 and all in a moment his roan\nRoll\u2019d neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;\nAnd there was my Roland to bear the whole weight\nOf the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,\nWith his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,\nAnd with circles of red for his eye-sockets\u2019 rim. Then I cast loose my buffcoat, each holster let fall,\nShook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,\nStood up in the stirrup, lean\u2019d, patted his ear,\nCall\u2019d my Roland his pet name, my horse without peer;\nClapp\u2019d my hands, laugh\u2019d and sang, any noise, bad or good,\nTill at length into Aix Roland gallop\u2019d and stood. And all I remember is, friends flocking round\nAs I sat with his head \u2018twixt my knees on the ground;\nAnd no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,\nAs I pour\u2019d down his throat our last measure of wine,\nWhich (the burgesses voted by common consent)\nWas no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.",
